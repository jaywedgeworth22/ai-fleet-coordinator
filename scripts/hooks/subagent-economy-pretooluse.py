"""PreToolUse hook for Agent / Task / Workflow -- binding enforcement of the
fleet's delegation rules.

WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT A PARAGRAPH
The rules below already exist in CLAUDE.md and AGENT-SYNC.md, and are violated on
essentially every spawn anyway.  That is structural, not forgetful: a subagent
with no `model` INHERITS the session model, nothing in the run output states which
tier was used, and the overspend is only visible afterward by reading agent meta
files.  A default that is invisible AND always wrong in one direction cannot be
fixed by restating it.  Compare the secret-guard hook next to this one: that rule
has never been violated, because it stops being a thing anyone has to remember.

DELEGATION IS THE GOAL, NOT THE COST
None of this discourages spawning agents.  Done right, delegation is faster AND
cheaper AND it keeps the owner's conversation open -- workers grind while the
managing agent stays responsive to chat.  Every deny below exists to stop the
three ways delegation gets done WRONG:
  1. every worker on the frontier tier because nobody chose one
  2. a worker that blocks the main loop, so the owner cannot talk to anyone
  3. two worktrees per agent, paying isolation cost twice for one benefit
The right move is almost always MORE agents at the RIGHT tier, in the background.
