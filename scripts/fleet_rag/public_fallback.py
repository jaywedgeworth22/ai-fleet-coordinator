"""Fall back to the public recall.jays.services service when the Tailscale-only Qdrant/TEI
path is unreachable from this Mac.

The Mac-side surfaces (the `recall` CLI and the stdio `fleet-recall-mcp.py`) call
`fleet_rag.recall_api` functions directly against TEI_URL / QDRANT_URL, which are Tailscale
mesh addresses (see docs/RAG-FLEET-INFRA.md).  When Tailscale is down on this Mac -- logged
out, a captive/corporate network blocking the control plane, or simply not running -- every
call to those addresses fails as a connection-level error (refused / reset / timeout).
`core.http_json` retries such an error 4 times with exponential backoff before giving up, so
the failure surfaces slowly and as an opaque `ConnectionError` / `RemoteDisconnected`
traceback.

This module gives those two surfaces a fast, actionable alternative:

  1. A cheap up-front check (`tailscale_status_text`, ~0.1-3s) reads `tailscale status` so an
     already-known-down Tailscale skips the slow local retry storm entirely and goes straight
     to the public path.  A machine with no Tailscale.app (Linux, CI, a relocated binary)
     reports "unknown", which is treated as "assume up" -- this module only ever *skips* the
     local path on positive evidence, never on the absence of the binary.
  2. Otherwise the local path still runs first -- Tailscale can flap, and "believed up" is a
     hint, not a guarantee -- but a CONNECTION-LEVEL failure from it (never an HTTP 4xx/5xx,
     which is a real answer from a reachable server) is caught and retried once against
     https://recall.jays.services's REST twin (`scripts/fleet-recall-service`).
  3. The public retry needs three names: `RECALL_API_TOKEN` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` /
     `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` (the Cloudflare Access service token) -- see
     docs/RECALL-ACCESS-CHECK.md.  A value already in the environment wins; otherwise each is
     read straight from its handoff file (PUBLIC_ENV_FILES: RECALL_API_TOKEN from
     ~/.secrets/global-api-keys, the Access pair from
     ~/.secrets/agents-jays-services-access-service-token.env) so this works from the stock
     `python3 fleet-recall-mcp.py` MCP registration with no shell wrapper.  The request also
     carries a real `User-Agent` (core.http_json sends none, and urllib's default trips
     Cloudflare's bot management -- 403, "error code: 1010").  A missing name, or a failure on
     the public path too (a rejected bearer, Access rejecting the service token, the box itself
     down), produces one plain-English, actionable line -- never a second opaque exception.

Only recall_search / recall_stats / recall_contribute are covered (the shared tool contract).
The public service's own argument set is a subset of the local one (no `per_doc`, `rerank`,
`prefer_lessons`, `force`; see `scripts/fleet-recall-service/server.py` TOOLS) -- those knobs
are silently dropped when a call actually falls back, and the near-duplicate contribute guard
(a local-only nicety, not part of the shared tool contract) is skipped rather than run against
an unreachable backend.

The Hetzner-side `fleet-recall-service` imports `recall_api` directly and never goes through
this module: it already runs on the box next to Qdrant/TEI and has no Tailscale hop to lose.

Callers must never engage the network path while a test has swapped `recall_api.Qdrant` for
`FakeQdrant` (`recall_api.install_fake_backend()`) -- see `using_fake_backend`.
