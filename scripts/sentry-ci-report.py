"""
sentry-ci-report.py — reports CI workflow outcomes to the shared fleet-infra
Sentry project (org jays-services), via raw envelope HTTP (no sentry-sdk
dependency, no GitHub Actions marketplace action).

Invoked by .github/workflows/sentry-ci-report.yml, which listens for
`workflow_run: types: [completed]` across every other workflow in this repo
and sets the env vars this script reads.  This script itself does not know
about GitHub Actions beyond reading those env vars — all the wiring lives in
the workflow file.

Two independent signals are sent per completed run:
  1. If the run's conclusion warrants an alert (failure / timed_out /
     startup_failure — see ALERT_CONCLUSIONS): a Sentry error event tagged with
     {app, workflow, branch, actor}, carrying the run URL, fingerprinted on
     [ci-failure, app, workflow] so every failure of one workflow groups into
     ONE Sentry issue instead of paging separately every time.
  2. If the run was schedule-triggered (event == "schedule"): a Sentry Crons
     check-in (status "ok" on success, "error" otherwise) with an upsert
     monitor_config whose schedule mirrors that workflow's own cron
     expression (see CRON_SCHEDULES below) so a nightly/weekly job that
     silently STOPS running raises a missed-check-in alert.

The branch is deliberately NOT part of the fingerprint (it was until
2026-08-12).  Branch names are unbounded and short-lived, so including one
minted a brand-new, permanent Sentry issue for every (workflow, branch) pair —
~85 of this fleet's 200+ unresolved fleet-infra issues came from that single
line, each one a dead feature branch nobody will ever look at again.  The
branch is still carried as a per-event TAG (searchable, and visible on every
event), which is where unbounded-cardinality data belongs.

The `app` tag + fingerprint component are required: fleet-infra is shared
across repos, and this repo may share workflow names ("CI", "Security",
"Effort Issues Sync") with peer apps, so without `app` a "CI" failure here
would dedup into the same Sentry issue as one there.  Per AGENT-SYNC.md
"Observability", every event is tagged with `app:<repo>`.

Secrets: SENTRY_FLEET_DSN is read only from the environment (set by the
workflow from the repo secret) and is NEVER printed or logged in any form,
including in exception messages.
