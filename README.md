# AI Fleet Coordinator

Coordination repo for Jay Wedgeworth's multi-agent coding fleet.  This is not a product app.  It holds the binding protocols, onboarding scripts, CI templates, Mac process inventory, and the daily digest site.

GitHub About should match this file.  Do not invent seats, hosts, or jobs that are not listed here or in `fleet-apps.json`.

## How the fleet works now

1. **THE BOARD first** — `https://mac.jays.services/board` (pm2 `mac-collab` on the Mac, public via Jay's Tunnel; short link `https://board.jays.services`).  Identify, claim, resolve, and comment here before guessing from six effort-log files.  Cloud agents use the same board.  Canonical: `AGENT-SYNC.md` § THE BOARD.
2. **`#agent-sync`** — Slack realtime claims and closeouts (channel id `C0BEZDJDNKV`).  Shared Mac relay is pm2 `agent-sync-push`.  Remote/cloud post: `POST https://agent-sync.jays.services/post`.  Canonical: `AGENT-SYNC.md`.
3. **Per-app effort boards** — live Mac copies (`~/apps/*-EFFORT-LOG.md`) plus each repo's `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` and GitHub Issues.  Two-way with THE BOARD: `mac-collab-sync` (files+issues → board) and `mac-collab-writeback` (board writes → live files + Issues).  Writeback does not push git; land `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` in the app PR.  Protocol: `EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md` and `docs/BOARD-WRITEBACK-PROTOCOL.md`.
4. **Mac always-on** — Shellular (phone → this Mac), `agent-sync-push`, `mac-collab`, `grok-leader` / `grok-acp`, scout, and the rest of the inventory.  Master list: [`docs/MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES.md`](docs/MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES.md).  Do not invent LaunchAgents from a cloud session.
5. **Seat worktrees** — each coding seat works in `~/apps/<prefix>-<suffix>` on its own branch prefix.  Never edit in `~/Code/<App>` (the human integration tree).
6. **No app-specific Grok Bot seats.**  Grok Bot seats implement through **Cursor cloud agents**.  Slack tags are `[GB-<NAME>]` (`GB-CONDUCTOR`, `GB-MONITOR`, `GB-FIXER`, `GB-DEPLOYER`, `GB-COMPILER`, `GB-NURSE`, `GB-HOUSEKEEPER`, `GB-ACCOUNTANT`, `GB-ORACLE`) — not `[GROK-BOT]`, not `[CURSOR]`, not `[GROK]`, not `[GB-FLEET]`.  Never `GB-COMPILE`.  This coordinator/ops system self-id is **`AFC`**.  `FLEET` is a Slack wake meaning every Grok Bot seat must spend time.  It is not Mac Grok (`GROK`), not Grok Build (`GROK-BUILD`), and it is not a per-app lane in `fleet-apps.json`.  Do not add `~/apps/<app>-grok-bot` seats.

## Apps and coding seats

Inventory: [`fleet-apps.json`](fleet-apps.json).  After any join, `python3 scripts/check-fleet-registry.py` must exit 0.

| App | Acronym | Kind |
|-----|---------|------|
| Socratic.Trade | ST | product |
| Congress.Trade | CT | product |
| Usage-Monitor | UM | product |
| congress-trading-shared | CTS | library |
| DealDex | DD | product |
| Personal-Site | PS | product |
| ai-fleet-coordinator | AFC | infra |

Coding seats in that file: `CLAUDE`, `MONET`, `CODEX`, `AG`, `CURSOR`, `GROK`, `GROK-BUILD`.  Roles: `AGENT-SYNC.md` § Agent Seat Specifics.

## Core protocols (still binding)

1. **Agent lanes:** dedicated persistent git worktrees.  They never overwrite each other's uncommitted work.
2. **Triple claim / triple closeout:** THE BOARD + effort-board/GitHub issue + `#agent-sync` at start and end of every real unit.
3. **Safe landings:** do not push directly to `main`.  Feature branch → verify → PR → merge when CI is green (`scripts/land.sh` where the app uses it).
4. **Fleet daily digest + calendars:** day-by-day HTML/Markdown of merged PRs, issue churn, and effort-board rows, plus two ICS feeds.  Hosted on GitHub Pages (see below).
5. **Apple Notes for owner review:** plans, designs, reviews, and completion notes go in folder **`Coding`** (local folder on this Mac, intentionally non-iCloud), pinned.  Title `[APP, Agent] short topic`.  Helper: `scripts/apple-notes-coding.sh`.  Full rule in `AGENT-SYNC.md`.
6. **Prior messages stay in scope:** new owner messages **add** work; they do **not** cancel earlier asks unless the owner explicitly contradicts, cancels, or clearly redirects.
7. **Secrets:** Infisical is the sole source of truth for **app runtime** secrets.  `~/.secrets/global-api-keys` is handoff-only (names-only inspectable via `GET https://mac.jays.services/files/key-names` with Bearer `$MAC_COLLAB_TOKEN`).  Never mix `COOLIFY_AGENTS` into app Infisical as `COOLIFY_API_TOKEN`.  Never bare `infisical secrets`.
8. **Fleet UI copy:** Title Case headings/buttons; sentence-case values; lowercase compact money; inline iOS nav titles.  See `FLEET-UI-COPY.md`.
9. **App versioning & TestFlight:** `1.0.N` patch versions.  TestFlight notes use Central Time and **no** internal agent names.
10. **Fleet Skills:** Per-seat catalog in `skills/` and `docs/fleet-skills/` (`fleet-coordination`, `session-start`, `board-ops`, `secret-handoff`, `sentence-gap`, `apple-notes`, `unstick-pr`, `land-lane`, `closeout`, `deploy-verify`, `codex-triage`, `pickup-seat`, `owner-copy`, `fleet-infra`, `dns-and-registrars`, `mac-cleanup`).  `ios-ship` is omitted from every seat — Compiler / `GB-COMPILER` owns GitHub-hosted `macos-latest` iOS ship; do not teach a local Mac runner.  DealDex's hosted Actions ship stays — do not disable it.  Kimi is not installed to `~/.kimi`.  Renoir is not installed to `~/.renoir/skills` until the seat is active.  Sync via `python3 scripts/install-fleet-skills.py`.

## Setup

1. **Create the Agent Lanes:**
   Run `./scripts/setup-agent-lanes.sh <base_path>` to create the isolated Git worktrees for your agents.
2. **Initialize Slack Sync:**
   Run `./scripts/setup-slack-sync.sh` and provide a Slack Bot Token to allow agents to coordinate.
3. **Install Fleet Skills:**
   Run `python3 scripts/install-fleet-skills.py` to sync the catalog into Cursor, Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Grok Build, Renoir, DeepSeek, Kimi (retired), Desktop Monet, and `docs/fleet-skills/by-seat/` (Claude/Grok Bot upload packs).  Each copy is rewritten to that seat's Slack tag, Notes name, branch prefix, and worktree.  Grok Bot copies use `[GB-<NAME>]` role tags, not `[GROK-BOT]`.  Omit a skill on a seat when it is not appropriate.  Do not leave Monet identity in another seat's folder.
4. **Apply the Rules:**
   Copy `TEMPLATE-AGENTS.md` to your own project's `AGENTS.md` and customize it.  Ensure all agents are instructed to read it.
5. **Setup GitHub Actions:**
   Copy the contents of `github-workflows-template/workflows` to your project's `.github/workflows` folder to enable automatic PR updating and (optionally) Sentry CI reporting.
6. **(Optional) Run Fleet Monitor:**
   Use the `fleet-sentry-monitor` PM2 ecosystem to track the health of your agent background processes.
7. **Subscribe to the fleet daily digest / calendars** (optional):
   See the next section.

## Onboard a new app or a new agent

Standing procedure (policy + checklist + scripts).  Do not invent a one-off join.  Do not invent a per-app Grok Bot seat.

## Fleet daily digest (HTML + Markdown + ICS)

Day-by-day outline of fleet work: **merged PRs**, **issues opened/closed**, and
**effort-board** bullets (`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` mirrors, or live boards under
`EFFORT_LOG_DIR` when building locally).  Built by
`scripts/build-fleet-daily-digest.py` and refreshed every 6 hours by
`.github/workflows/fleet-activity-site.yml`, which also rebuilds the per-commit
activity ICS and deploys the site to **GitHub Pages**.

### Subscribe (Apple / Google / Outlook)

**Recommended:** daily outline ICS (one all-day event per day with PR/issue/effort summary).

**Apple Calendar (iOS):** Calendar → Calendars → Add Calendar → Add Subscription Calendar → paste HTTPS URL → Find.

**Google Calendar (web):** Other calendars → + → From URL → paste URL.

**Google Calendar (iOS):** Google's mobile "Add Subscription Calendar" is picky; if it says *Validation failed*, add the same URL on [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com) (web) instead — mobile will then show the subscribed calendar.

CDN alternate for the commit feed (sometimes validates more cleanly on mobile):

```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaywedgeworth22/ai-fleet-coordinator@main/calendar/agent-activity.ics
```

### Enable GitHub Pages (one-time)

Repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
The workflow uses `actions/deploy-pages`.  First successful run after that publishes
the site URL above.

### Optional: private repo coverage

Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` sees public repos only.  To include private fleet repos
(e.g. `Congress.Trade`, `DealDex`), add a fine-grained PAT (read-only Contents + Issues on
those repos) as Actions secret **`FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN`**.

### Local rebuild

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"   # or FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN
export EFFORT_LOG_DIR=/Users/jay/apps    # optional: live effort boards
python3 scripts/build-agent-calendar.py
python3 scripts/build-fleet-daily-digest.py
# outputs: site/index.html, site/digest.md, calendar/daily-digest.ics
```

ICS line-folding uses `scripts/ics_utils.py` (RFC 5545 octet folding) so Apple/
Google accept long DESCRIPTION lines.
