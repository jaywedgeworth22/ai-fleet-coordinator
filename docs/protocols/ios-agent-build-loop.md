# iOS agent build loop (owner ruling 2026-08-13 — ALL seats, ALL apps)

> Moved from `AGENT-SYNC.md` on 2026-09-01 (Plan B slice 2, doc diet).  Still binding for every agent on every platform.  Canonical pointer stays in AGENT-SYNC.md; this file is the full text and is ingested into the fleet-agents corpus (`recall`).

Owner: do **not** stand up, debug, or "fix" Xcode MCP (`XcodeBuildMCP`, `xcrun mcpbridge`, `build_sim`).  We are not using that path.

**`xcodebuild` and `xcrun simctl` via the shell are the default, pre-approved tools.**  Run them.  Do not ask permission.  Do not pause to explain that MCP is missing.  Do not write a paragraph about why you cannot use `build_sim`.  Never block bash `xcodebuild` — that is the only iOS compile loop this fleet uses.

**Verify:** a simulator screenshot (`xcrun simctl io booted screenshot …`) is required before claiming a user-visible iOS client change is done.  `BUILD SUCCEEDED` is not visual QA.  Discover simulators with `xcrun simctl list devices available` — do not hardcode a device name.

**Do not hand-edit** `.pbxproj`, anything inside `.xcodeproj/` or `.xcworkspace/`, `.xib`, `.storyboard`, or `.entitlements`.  Create the `.swift` file and report that it needs target membership.  Where the app uses XcodeGen (ST `ios/project.yml`, UM `ios/UsageMonitor/project.yml`), edit `project.yml` and run `xcodegen generate` — do not patch the generated `project.pbxproj` by hand.  Claude seats: a PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/block-xcode-project-writes.py`, template in ai-fleet-coordinator + `/Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/`) enforces the write block.

Architecture unless the file you are editing already differs:

- `@Observable` + `@MainActor` on stores (never `ObservableObject`)
- `NavigationStack` + value-based `NavigationLink` (never `NavigationView` / destination-closure links)
- Light is the product default theme
- Two spaces between sentences in every human-readable string, including App Store listing and review notes (see § Two spaces between sentences)

Signing / TestFlight last-mile stays `scripts/ios-ship-testflight.sh` + `/Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/README.md`.  Do not debug code-signing by guessing.

Per-app iOS onboarding (annotated file tree + scheme): `ios/CLAUDE.md`, `clients/ios/CLAUDE.md`, or `native/ios/CLAUDE.md`.

**iOS Debug vs TestFlight (owner 2026-08-21 — ALL seats).**  Do the Xcode-console kind of debug **as autonomously as possible**.  Ask the owner only when the phone, signing, or a gesture is actually blocking.  Helper (on-demand, not a daemon): `bash /Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/ios-debug.sh <app>`.  Tracked copy: `ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/ios-debug.sh`.

Do **not** open the Xcode GUI and do **not** make the owner press Run as the default.  The helper is the console: simulator `simctl launch --console` (print/NSLog) plus `log stream` / device `log collect`.  `xcrun devicectl` can also screenshot and launch on a paired phone.

When to use which path:

1. **Simulator Debug (default).**  UI, layout, most logic, `print` / `os_log`.  `ios-debug.sh` with default `--target simulator`.  Screenshot stays required for user-visible changes.
2. **Device logs, keep TestFlight.**  Phone-only bug (push, IAP, background, Keychain, camera, Health, entitlements) where TestFlight/Release is the truth.  `--target device --logs-only`.  Does **not** replace the TestFlight install.  Unified logs only — `print()` from a Release/TestFlight build often never appears.
3. **Device Debug install.**  Only when we need `#if DEBUG`, an unreleased binary, or a debugger-attached equivalent on the phone.  `--target device --install-debug`.  This **replaces** TestFlight for that bundle until the owner reinstalls from TestFlight.  Say that in the turn you do it.
4. **Owner presses Run in Xcode.**  Last resort: LLDB (`po`, breakpoints, pause-on-exception) or the IDE console still has the smoking gun after (1)–(3).  Ask for a paste of that pane rather than narrating MCP.

Ask the owner (short `NEED OWNER:` line) only for: plug/unlock/trust the phone, enable Developer Mode, Allow/Touch ID on a signing dialog, or “reproduce this tap now, I have N seconds of logs.”  Do not wait for them to start a Debug session if the helper can run.

Do **not** treat an Xcode Run as a substitute for a TestFlight repro.  Debug + development signing is a different binary.  Known trap: ST push sandbox vs `#if DEBUG` (TestFlight is not DEBUG).
