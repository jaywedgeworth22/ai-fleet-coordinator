> ⚠️ **AGENT AVAILABILITY NOTICE (2026-08-21):** KIMI is **RETIRED / UNAVAILABLE** long-term (owner directive). All agents MUST NOT assign work or wait on KIMI in-flight work. Reassign any open KIMI effort board lanes or GitHub issues to active seats (AG, GROK, CLAUDE, MONET, etc.).

- **2026-09-01 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Dock launcher for local DSH web (branch `grok/dsh-dock-launcher`, worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-dsh-dock`).**  Always-on `dsh-web` idle ~12 MB / 0% CPU — leave it running.  `~/Applications/DeepSeek Harness Web.app` opens Chrome `--app=http://127.0.0.1:3080/` with no Terminal.  Full-bleed square icon (not the official squircle).

- **2026-09-01 — GROK — COMPLETED/MERGED #162 — DSH web :3080 on Tailscale + Shellular Thinking hang (branch `grok/dsh-tailscale-shellular`, worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-dsh-shellular`, board `32dbbf8d`).**  Web UI default is 127.0.0.1:3080; Tailscale Serve `https://macbook.boa-roygbiv.ts.net:3080`.  Shellular listed sessions then hung on Thinking because headless dsh is silent until the final answer, ACP stdin was inherited, and timeout did not kill the process group.  Bridge 1.3.0: DEVNULL stdin, process-group kill, heartbeats.  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-09-01-dsh-tailscale-shellular-thinking.md`.
- **2026-09-01 — GROK — COMPLETED/MERGED #159 — Sentry fleet adoption standing split + CI/ship hygiene (branch `grok/sentry-fleet-adoption`, worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-sentry-adopt`, board `42c563a6`).**  Implementation of the 2026-09-01 adoption report: Personal-Site Datadog-only, no Sentry project for CTS/fleet-ops, Android deferred, Seer gated to ST+CT, overlap table, CI fingerprints `[app, workflow]` only, Size Analysis TODO on ios-fleet ship (no new LaunchAgent).  Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-09-01-sentry-fleet-adoption.md`.  Runtime crons/DSNs/SDKs stay other lanes.  Slack `#agent-sync` post skipped (`account_inactive` / 403).
- **2026-09-01 — GROK — COMPLETED/MERGED #158 — Sentry sponsored-account fleet integration plan (branch `grok/sentry-fleet-integration-plan`, worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-sentry-plan`, board `6ac85c0e`).**  Live inventory of org `jays-services` (8 projects, 0 alert rules, stale crons, ST uptime failing on homepage).  Plan: `docs/plans/2026-09-01-sentry-fleet-integration.md`.  No runtime changes.  Slack `#agent-sync` post skipped (`account_inactive`).
- **2026-09-01 — CLAUDE — IN PR — Canonical `## Never idle-watch a PR` section in `AGENT-SYNC.md` (branch `claude/never-idle-watch-rule`).**  Owner ruling 2026-09-01: agents "should never just wait and watch for things to merge since that wastes tokens/time and they inevitably almost invariably end up slowly wasting money/quota while the PR sits there with conflicts or comments/issues unresolved."  New section placed directly after `## Merge requirements`, byte-identical to the live `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` copy so the tracked GitHub file does not drift.  Substance: a PR that is not merging is waiting on an ACTION, not on time — a symptom->diagnosis->action table (unresolved review threads, merge conflict, failing check, never-dispatched check, auto-merge never armed, branch behind main), arm auto-merge at PR-open, at most ONE bounded `gh pr checks <n> --watch` then diagnose rather than wait again, batch review-bot thread triage, and end the turn rather than narrate "standing by" on background jobs.  This is the canonical home; the app repos and the owner's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` cross-reference it.  Sibling PRs: Socratic.Trade, Congress.Trade, Usage-Monitor.  Docs only.
- **2026-08-31 — AG — COMPLETED / PR OPEN — Fleet Sentry monitor expansion & project provisioning (branch `ag/sentry-observability-expansion`).**  Added `dealdex` and `botfleet` to `PROD_HEALTH_ENDPOINTS` with JSON/HTTP response detection, added PM2 tags, and provisioned Sentry projects `botfleet`, `autorotate`, and `contactlogo` under org `jays-services`. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-08-31-fleet-sentry-monitor-expansion.md`.
- **2026-08-31 — CLAUDE — DEPLOYED — Self-hosted bge-m3 embeddings + `fleet-agents` Qdrant collection.**  Board `7dbd6228`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-claude-embeddings` @ `claude/local-embeddings-fleet-rag`.  Coolify service `tei-bge-m3` (`cday9viyj6mwlfr8egnoknoa`, mesh-only `100.69.77.26:8081`, bearer auth, 6 CPU / 10 GiB) plus collection `fleet-agents` in the existing `qdrant-st` instance (1024-dim cosine, 8 payload indexes, full-text on `text`).  Creds canonical in Infisical shared/prod.  Client `scripts/fleet-rag.py`; docs `docs/RAG-FLEET-INFRA.md`.  **Measured blocker:** self-hosted vectors are NOT space-compatible with the OpenRouter-embedded `socratic-trade` corpus (cosine mean 0.869, self-retrieval Recall@1 64% vs an 88% stored-vector ceiling), so this must not be swapped in as ST's embed provider without a full re-embed.
- **2026-08-23 — CURSOR — IN PROGRESS — Shellular iOS DeepSeek thinking hang (`cursor/shellular-deepseek-thinking-fix-e0b0`).**  Harness `approval: ask` blocked phone clients; `dsh-acp` now auto-approves via `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE=danger-full-access`.
- **2026-08-22 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Harden THE BOARD two-way sync (`mac-collab-writeback`).**  Board `c76c7feb`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-board-writeback` @ `grok/board-writeback`.  Stopped the looping first-run job; surgical md; applied-status bootstrap; REST Issues; no `~/Code` git.
- **2026-08-22 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Harden THE BOARD two-way sync (`mac-collab-writeback`).**  Board `c76c7feb`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-board-writeback` @ `grok/board-writeback`.  Stopped the looping first-run job; surgical md; applied-status bootstrap; REST Issues; no `~/Code` git.
- **2026-08-22 — GROK — DEPLOYED — Redirect board.jays.services to mac.jays.services/board.**  Cloudflare proxied `AAAA 100::` + Single Redirect 302 (query string preserved).  Verified `Location: https://mac.jays.services/board`.  Board `b89c8330`.  Branch `grok/board-redirect`.

- **[FLEET][GROK] Unstick merge+deploy across apps — IN PROGRESS 2026-08-21 (board 8b7665ce).**  Merged FLEET #67, CT #2089, CT #1966.  ST prod 39 commits behind: RTH latch is correct; evening drain was silent-green.  Drain fix in `grok/rth-drain-nudge`.  UM/CTS/DD/PS had no open PRs; UM live sha matches main.  Remaining ST #3008/#2941 real conflicts, #2990 gitleaks dummy key, #2993 dependabot verify fail, Autorotate #17 CI red, CT drafts parked.

## LIVE 2026-08-19 ~11:33pm CT — Shellular relay + wedged pm2 RPC
- Phone flapped because daemon was stuck on `relay.ap-south.shellular.dev` (1006 / ECONNRESET) and `pm2 jlist` hung, so the 120s watch never restarted anything.
- Pinned `~/.shellular/relay-cache.json` to `relay.us-west.shellular.dev`. Bounced God + `pm2 resurrect`. Killed orphan pid 70006 that blocked the new daemon.
- Watch (`~/apps/mac-process-watch.sh`): 8s jlist timeout, stray CLI kill, God+resurrect on RPC hang, bounce Shellular if relay-dead while process still "online". Also watch `grok-leader` + `mac-collab`.
- `com.jay.shellular` stays **disabled** (launchd vs pm2 fight).
- **2026-08-16 — GROK — COMPLETED — Restart intended always-on Mac jobs.**  Other agents had already brought them back (pm2 dump matched live).  Restarted scout / senate-relay / senate-tunnel / agent-sync-push / code-main-keeper.  All 10 pm2 jobs online after.  Local + public Senate relay `/health` 200; `/fetch-ptr` 4 rows.  agent-sync `/health` 200.  Watch: all expected online.  Scout Senate *breaker* still OPEN (direct eFD `report/data/` 503 maintenance); that is the handshake, not a dead process — production uses the working relay.
- **2026-08-16 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Mac jobs into pm2 + down-watch logs (live `~/apps`).**  10 pm2 jobs online.  Moved vision-worker / xcode-health / cursor-slack-sync / agy-acp off launchd.  Ecosystem `~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs`.  Watch `bash ~/apps/mac-process-watch.sh` + `com.jay.mac-process-watch`.  Status: `bash ~/apps/mac-status.sh`.
- **2026-08-16 — GROK — IN PR — Point fleet docs at renamed Apple Note `⭐️ Background Jobs Master List` (branch `grok/note-title`).**  AGENT-SYNC + TEMPLATE-AGENTS + ONBOARDING-NEW-AGENT + docs/MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES mirror live list.  App PRs: CT/ST/UM/DealDex `grok/note-title`.
# fleet-infra Effort Log — cross-agent board
Protocol: /Users/jay/apps/EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md (canonical). Live board: this file.
NO repo mirror / issues mirror — fleet-infra is machine-side (/Users/jay/apps, pm2, hooks,
protocol docs), not a git repo. Cross-repo efforts that land IN a repo get rows on that
repo's board too. As of 2026-08-17. 2026-08-17 GROK board hygiene: one In Progress section (hygiene + FDA/Xcode/iMessage).

## Deployed
- **2026-08-26 — AG — DEPLOYED/MERGED #123 — Audit and resolve reviewer comments across past 2 weeks.**  Claimed Wed, Aug 26, 2026.  Fixed mac-auto-cleanup worktree idle/clean checks and agent-sync runtime preservation (#122), dsh-acp watchdog timeout, session/load resume, supported mode restriction (#110, #111), cursor_acp_cloud_bridge authMethods and follow-up response wait (#75), and registry consistency.  Resolved all 19 open review threads via GraphQL.  PR #123 merged to main.
- (n/a — machine-side infra is "deployed" when running under pm2/hooks; see Completed)

## In Progress
- **2026-08-30 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — seat-mcp grok sessionId flush + one-job queue (`grok/seat-flush`).**  Board `51965c1b`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-seat-flush`.  Job 401c53c0/15958b82: sessionId none, bytesOut 0, 900s -15.  Do not start grok-leader.  Do not extra-ship ST.
- **2026-08-30 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — grok-acp auto-approve permissions + ACP terminals (`grok/acp-auto-approve`).**  Board `e1dc9024`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-acp-auto-approve`.  Pick offered allow option on `session/request_permission`; implement `terminal/*`; acp-home `[ui] permission_mode = always-approve`.  Not rebasing ST #3120.  Not restarting grok-leader.
- **2026-08-29 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Per-session MCP pick for grok-acp (`grok/acp-mcp-pick`).**  Board `1613bd82`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-acp-mcp-pick`.  `opts.mcpServers` names on `seat_launch` grok only.  grok-acp stripped `GROK_HOME`.  TUI keeps the full set.  No TUI picker.
- **2026-08-27 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — TUI drive follow-ups + cloud hop (`grok/tui-drive-cloudhop`).**  Board `56cc91fd`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-tui-cloudhop`.  Install-on-merge, await-next-turn, pendingTool, self-guard, tracked seat-mcp launchers, cloud MCP hop `agents.jays.services`.  Generic any-seat.
- **2026-08-27 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Grok Bot drive for live Grok TUI sessions (`grok/tui-drive`).**  Board `d854b8b4`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-tui-drive`.  leader-client `prompt`/`peek`, `grok-drive.py`, seat-mcp v1.1 `grok_sessions_list`/`grok_session_prompt`, skill `drive-grok-tui` (GB + Cursor).  Handshake ok; list 30 sessions / 2 live.  Did not inject a test prompt into the live TUI.
- **2026-08-25 — CURSOR — IN PROGRESS — agy-acp session/list wrapper (`cursor/agy-acp-session-list-2365`).**  Thin NDJSON proxy so Shellular can list Antigravity sessions.  Does not rewrite agy-acp.  Does not change `start.sh` / `:8765`.  Keepouts: agents.json, grok-acp, launchd.
- **2026-08-25 — CURSOR — COMPLETED — Harden pm2 agy-acp fail-closed (`cursor/agy-acp-fail-closed-387d`, #117).**  Track turbo.sh; start.sh child is turbo; grace 300s; bind persist via `bind-loopback.cjs`.  Keepouts: grok-acp, Shellular agents.json, session scanner.
- **2026-08-23 — CURSOR — IN PROGRESS — fx skill discovery (`cursor/fx-skills-yaml`).**  Fold quoted SKILL.md descriptions (`malformed_quote`), install FX seat to `~/.fx/skills`, raise fx `skill_catalog_bytes`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-cursor-fx-skills`.
- **2026-08-23 — CURSOR — IN PROGRESS — Per-seat fleet skill identity (`cursor/fleet-skill-seat-identity`).**  Specialize platform skill installs so Cursor/AG/Codex/Grok do not inherit `[MONET]`.
- **2026-08-22 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — KIMI unclaim leftover work; claims must show the claim date.**  Claimed Sat, Aug 22, 2026.  Board `f8126c1e`.  Worktree `~/apps/fleet-grok-kimi-clear` @ `grok/kimi-unclaim-claim-dates`.  KIMI must have nothing In Progress or Planned.  Slack/board `--where` carry `claimed: <date>`.

- **2026-08-21 — CURSOR — COMPLETED/DEPLOYED — Mac share hardening.** Coordinator #76 merged. CT #2152 merged and live (`build.sha` `f80afd47`). ACP loopback+WAF. Collab no secrets HTTP. Agent-sync WS gated. Slack token out of LaunchAgent. mcp.json launchers. Board 8-char prefixes. Daily findings.db snapshot. Mac `SENATE_RELAY_REQUIRE=1`: public `/fetch-ptr` 401, authed 200, `/health` 200. Production Senate poll succeeding after require. Keepout held: `deepseek/seat-onboard`.
- **2026-08-21 — CURSOR — COMPLETED (evaluation) — Mac share vs hosted MCP + security review.** Owner asked whether a Mac-hosted MCP would beat the current HTTP/`board` share, plus a vuln/best-practice/custom-opt pass. Verdict: do **not** tunnel an MCP; keep HTTPS + `board` CLI. Live P0s: public `acp.jays.services` (agy-acp *:8765, 426), `MAC_COLLAB_TOKEN` serves `global-api-keys` (111 names), unauth `scout` `/fetch-ptr` 200, unauth `agent-sync` WebSocket upgrade, Slack bot token in `com.jay.provider-knob-sync.plist`, live tokens in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` args. Box at review: load ~174, swap 25.9/26.6GB, Application Firewall off. Canvas + Apple Note. No code change this turn.
- **2026-08-21 — GROK — COMPLETED — Automate Mac + Hetzner recovery.** Watch: dump-safe jlist-timeout, HTTP /health bounce, Shellular ioreg.  Host: fleet-health-recover@socratic-app and @usage-monitor active; verify Pushover.  Merged #66.  Board `21c68868`.
- **2026-08-21 — GROK — COMPLETED — Apple Notes HTML sentence gap (`&nbsp; `).** Owner: double space after period in HTML too.  Notes.app collapses ASCII doubles.  Helper converts leftover `.  ` to `&nbsp; `.  Merged coordinator #60.
- **2026-08-21 — GROK — COMPLETED — Apple Notes section spacing.** Owner: space sections apart.  Helper MD converter dropped blanks; now emits `<div><br></div>` between sections and bullets.  Skills + AGENT-SYNC.  Live `~/apps/apple-notes-coding.sh`.  Incident note rewritten `--html`.  Merged coordinator #59.
- **2026-08-21 — CURSOR — COMPLETED (Mac-local) — sessionStart hook + watch dump-incomplete fallback.**  Confirmed 14 pm2 online 02:29.  Hook `~/.cursor/hooks.json` sessionStart fail-open 8s.  Rule `~/.cursor/rules/mac-local-processes.mdc`.  Grok owns the RCA row below.
- **2026-08-21 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Mac total service collapse RCA + restore.** Last healthy 22:29 CT 2026-08-20. pm2 RPC wedge → 4/hour watch backoff → overnight crash-loops (`ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED`) → dsh session started only vision-worker → `pm2 kill` dumped that one-job list over `~/.pm2/dump.pm2` at 01:40/01:59 → crash reboot 01:58 and 02:04 (wtmp `crash`, shutdown_stall, JetsamEvent largest=Cursor Helper Renderer). 16GB Mac17,3 + macOS 27.0 beta. Post-boot stampede: CleanMyMac, Autorotate Swift/tsc, Cursor/Monet, ~90 npm MCP. Restored from `~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` + `mac-collab-sync`. Dump now 14 jobs. Local `/health` 200 on :8791/:8792/:8787/:8899. Watch cannot self-heal a poisoned dump (`missing>=3` only resurrects). Board `7ed75922`.  Do not `pm2 save` unless the full 14 are online.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Coolify disk hygiene pager (host install + CT `grok/disk-hygiene-alert`).**  14h at 93–99% with syslog-only ALERT.  Wire Pushover from `/etc/congress-health-recover.env`, trim backups/scratch, 15-min timer.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Unstick and merge all open fleet PRs to production.** Owner: resolve conflicts, review comments, merge to production across ST/CT/UM/CTS/DD/PS/FLEET.  Inventory: ST 13 CONFLICTING; CT 8 MERGEABLE/BLOCKED + 11 CONFLICTING (9 draft); UM 4 CLEAN (1 draft); DD 1 CLEAN + 2 CONFLICTING; FLEET 2 CLEAN; CTS/PS none.  Board `8b7665ce`.  Worktrees per-repo `*-grok-unstick`.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — COMPLETED — Install Desktop fleet-skills into Grok (`~/.grok/skills`).** Owner: update grok with the skills on Desktop now.  Adapted Monet pack (12 SKILL.md) to GROK identity (`[GROK]`, `grok/`, `~/apps/<prefix>-grok`) and installed user-scoped copies.  `grok inspect --json`: all 12 `source.type=user`.  Slash `/session-start` `/board-ops` `/closeout` `/secret-handoff` `/owner-copy` `/apple-notes` `/land-lane` `/unstick-pr` `/codex-triage` `/pickup-seat` `/deploy-verify` `/ios-ship`.  Board `6ab9161ca7f94f09ae94b47305ec46e9`.  Desktop pack left as Monet upload source.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — COMPLETED — Refresh Monet Desktop fleet-skills pack.** Owner: update `~/Desktop/fleet-skills` for the MONET Claude.app library.  Jul 13 copies were ST-only and stale.  Rewrote 5 skills + added session-start, board-ops, closeout, secret-handoff, apple-notes, ios-ship, owner-copy.  Git copy merged ai-fleet-coordinator PR #52.  Board `f78464cb`.  Remaining: owner upload on the MONET login.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — GROK-BOT 5-day Mac takeover (through 2026-08-25).** Owner: this Mac GROK TUI takes the GROK-BOT queue.  Grok Bot.app is Cursor (`com.anysphere.sand`) and only launches Cursor cloud agents; local chats already sit on `grok-leader`.  No Cursor cloud from this seat unless owner asks.  Board `c8d325b9`.  2h babysit loop.  PR conflicts/CI/comments across ST/CT/UM/DealDex.  Keepouts: CT #1959, extract-halt-banner.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — COMPLETED — mac-collab + xcode-health errored (orphans held 8792/8791).** pm2 both errored `Address already in use`.  1:09am CT orphans (pids 53430/53461) held the ports; `/health` empty-reply/timeout.  Killed orphans, `pm2 reset` + restart, `pm2 save`.  Local + public `/health` 200 (`mac.jays.services`, `xcode.jays.services`).  Board `fb192d16`.
- **2026-08-19 — CURSOR — LIVE — mac.jays.services collab tunnel.** pm2 `mac-collab` on `127.0.0.1:8792`. Same named tunnel (ingress v8) + proxied CNAME. Public `/health`. Token-gated `/files` + `/files/<name>` (allowlist only). Token `~/.secrets/mac-collab.env` (`MAC_COLLAB_TOKEN`, never print). xcode + scout `/health` still 200. Do not mint TryCloudflare. Do not change `SENATE_RELAY_URL`.
- **2026-08-18 — GROK — COMPLETED/LIVE — Max local Grok chat control.** pm2 `grok-leader` on `~/.grok/leader.sock` (`--always-approve`, `--no-exit-on-disconnect`). Shellular spawn `grok agent --always-approve --leader stdio`. `[cli] use_leader = true` for new TUI. `leader-client.py list` saw 30 sessions including this chat. grok-acp stays `--no-leader serve` on `:12419` (`--leader serve` does not bind). Never `:2419`. This TUI left running.
- **2026-08-18 — GROK — COMPLETED/LIVE — Restore Shellular Grok ACP (`ACP connection closed`).** Wrong argv `grok agent stdio --always-approve` (flag belongs on `agent`).  Fixed `~/.shellular/agents.json` to `~/.grok/bin/grok agent --always-approve stdio`.  Homebrew node restored (`merve` 1.2.2_2 + node 26.7.0).  grok-acp on `:12419` only.  Phone client reconnected 4:21pm.
- **2026-08-17 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Rebuild UM Client + Local with Xcode.app on this Mac.** Owner: agents use normal `/Applications/Xcode.app` here (`xcodebuild` / `simctl`). Not parked on “beta host”.
- **2026-08-17 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Effort-board hygiene + this-session control board.** Hygiene PRs armed.
- **2026-08-16 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — FDA for Xcode Python.app + iOS 26.5 platform + TestFlight ships.**  iOS 26.5 runtime installed (`23F77`).  CT 1.0.17 archive running (stuck at provisioning/keychain — needs owner Allow/Touch ID if a dialog is up).  SIP blocked TCC.db write; launchd iMessage still needs FDA toggle in System Settings.  Listener is up from this session.

## Completed
- **2026-08-21 — GROK — COMPLETED — iOS Debug-install vs TestFlight (autonomous device logs).** Helper `~/apps/ios-fleet/ios-debug.sh`. Policy in AGENT-SYNC § iOS agent build loop. Merged coordinator #77. Board `cbc1edeb`.
- **2026-08-21 — GROK — COMPLETED — grok-leader lock-held restart storm.**  `ms` showed pm2 grok-leader `errored` (355 restarts).  This TUI holds `~/.grok/leader.sock`.  Watch skip was a no-op: LaunchAgent PATH omitted `/usr/sbin` and `lsof` lives only there.  Stopped the job.  Watch + plist PATH + `leader.sh` exit 75.  Landed coordinator #74.  ios-ship-now is the 2026-08-13 login leftover.  Board `0095ae36`.
- **2026-08-21 — MONET — COMPLETED — Handoff note covering all 10 open, unarchived Mac sessions.**  Board item `311e1ab5`.  Merged #68 → `docs/handoffs/2026-08-21-open-sessions-handoff.md`.  Every claim re-verified against live state rather than trusting the transcripts, and the drift is recorded: pm2 at 11/14 not 14/14, `xcode-health` +116 restarts since an agent offered to clear its orphan, three PRs the session metadata still shows open are closed, disk back from 104GB to 84GB free.  Three findings only visible across sessions: the ST sign-in-button lane stopped mid-work with no closing summary, so its diagnosis (grey box = SwiftUI default bordered style, not custom CSS) and its verified finding that the current teal Google button violates Google's own brand rules existed nowhere else; two agents are working the same strategy-run P0 from incompatible diagnoses (board `06df80cf` gather-timeout vs an equity-floor gate reading 0 that writes no run row at all, with ST #3018 fixing only the first); and three lanes are the same pm2-orphan mechanism, stated once in the note — orphaned children keep the listening socket, so every health probe reports green while pm2's managed copy can never bind.
- **2026-08-21 — CLAUDE — COMPLETED — Shellular down, `pm2 status` empty, XcodeBuildMCP timing out: root-caused as two separate problems.**  Board item `2dc5da58`.  Shellular was NOT a duplicate install and NOT launchd — it crash-looped on `/bin/sh: ioreg: command not found` because pm2 replays the env cached at an app's FIRST start, and that cached PATH had no `/usr/sbin`, while `pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` had `/usr/sbin:/sbin` correct all along.  Fixed via `pm2 delete` + ecosystem start (online, 0 restarts, 0 ioreg errors); `pm2 save` restored `dump.pm2` to all 14 jobs after the 01:05/01:40 kills poisoned it down to 1.  The wider outage was RAM/CPU, not disk (~108GB free; swap 12.4/14.3GB, ~400k pageouts, load ~800) — that is why every stdio MCP server timed out at 30s and XcodeBuildMCP's tools failed while `xcrun simctl` worked fine.  Lessons written into `MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES.md` in #61 and #62.  OPEN follow-up: `mac-process-watch.sh` still runs `pm2 resurrect` only on the 3+-missing path and never falls through to an ecosystem start, so a poisoned dump cannot self-heal.
- **2026-08-20 — KIMI / 2026-08-21 — CURSOR — COMPLETED — Onboard Autorotate as fleet app (TS).** GitHub repo public (`jaywedgeworth22/Autorotate`). Coordinator PR #57 merged. App PR #16 merged (`c1f12a5`) after CURSOR fixed web `npm ci` (lockfile hosts were npmmirror + msh.team). Local iOS/macOS first builds succeeded; Effort Issues Sync run 32458648310 success; `~/Code/Autorotate` ff to merge. Slack + Apple Notes closeout by CURSOR. Owner leftovers: branch protection, Infisical, ASC, SENTRY_FLEET_DSN. Dependabot #1–15 still open.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — COMPLETED — Coolify host disk reclaim (fleet-hetzner-nbg1).** Owner: free disk space swiftly.  Overnight hygiene had used=97% / 4.5G free; this turn started at 97G used / 67%.  Deleted completed 2026-08-18 ST restore drills (`/data/scratch/socratic-restore-20260818`, `/data/backups/restore-proof/socratic-restore-scratch-20260817`, ~10G), extra ST snapshot beyond KEEP_COUNT=3 (`socratic-app-20260820T061501Z.db`, ~6G), unused Docker images+build cache (~5G), idle GH runner `_work` on ct-1/ct-2 (~3.6G).  Did **not** prune named volumes (ST 24G / UM 1.6G live).  Result: **72G used / 73G free / 50%**.  ST/CT/UM `/api/health` ok.  `box-disk-hygiene.timer` still active.  sqlite3 `.backup` of live ST `app.db` still running (pid 1449140, dest 6.43G / source 6.77G) — left it to finish.  Board `117f3de8`.
- **2026-08-20 — GROK — COMPLETED — Fleet GitHub PR inventory for production.** Owner asked for every PR that should go to production.  Seven scouts (ST/CT/UM/CTS/DD/PS/FLEET).  Real gap is already-merged, not-live: ST 9 PRs (prod `e0a4959a` vs main `0a7ffa74`; Coolify silent freeze, do not hand-trigger) and CT 10 PRs (prod `6ebb15eb` vs main `4b9694d10714`; Coolify stuck after IAP/extract burst).  UM 1 docs-only (#1292).  PS #9 merged but merge≠live.  DealDex prod==main.  CTS no tag needed.  Open: 42 PRs, 0 product READY_TO_MERGE (ST all conflicting; CT CI missing after rebase).  Did not merge or deploy.  Board `b256453d`.  Note `[ST, CT, UM, DD, PS, FLEET, Grok] PRs to production`.
- **2026-08-17 — GROK — BOARD HYGIENE — folded the duplicate lower In Progress (July 2026 audit leftovers + already-COMPLETED onboard rows). First lines unchanged.**
- **2026-08-14 — GROK — COMPLETED — Onboard Personal-Site as a fleet app (PS).** Personal-Site PR #1 + coordinator PR #28 merged.  Social short-link 301s live.  Live Vercel project is not on the fleet MCP team.

- **2026-08-14 — GROK — COMPLETED — Onboarding links + subagent/economics wording.** Fleet #25 + DealDex #40 merged. ST #2711 / CT #1859 / UM #1190 auto-merge armed. Live AGENT-SYNC + QUICKSTART + seat globals already updated.

- **2026-08-14 — GROK-BUILD — COMPLETED — Register Grok Build as a standing fleet seat (PR #26).** Tag `GROK-BUILD`, Notes name `Grok Build`, suffix `grok-build`, prefix `grok-build/`.  DealDex PR #41 closed the app-side docs.  AGENT-SYNC seat table still open for Mac Grok.

- **2026-08-13 — GROK — COMPLETED — iOS agent build-loop policy (no Xcode MCP; bash xcodebuild pre-approved).** Fleet #24 merged. DD #18 + UM #1178 merged. ST #2705 + CT #1850 auto-merge armed. Live `~/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` already has the section.

- **2026-08-12 — GROK — IN PROGRESS — Mac Xcode runner does not update the phone.** Runners were online but only unsigned-compile (`ios-build.yml`; ST PR #2648 not on main). TestFlight shipping was ad-hoc. ST latest builds stuck `MISSING_EXPORT_COMPLIANCE` (patched live to IN_BETA_TESTING). Adding `ios-ship.yml` on the Mac runners + ship-script compliance auto-declare + ST min iOS 17. Worktrees `trading-grok-tf-runner` / `congress-grok-tf-runner` / `usage-grok-tf-runner`.

- **2026-08-10 2:03am CT — GROK — DEPLOYED — Box disk hygiene + health-recover hardening (Monet handoff).** Added `scripts/ops/box-disk-hygiene.{sh,service,timer}` (30min: df + SQLite/WAL sizes + docker system df; light prune when ok; builder+image prune-af at ≥80% used or <15G free; aggressive system prune at ≥90%/<8G; skips during Coolify builds; no volume prune by default). Installed+enabled on `fleet-hetzner-nbg1`; timer active, first live run level=ok (75% / 37G free). Hardened `congress-health-recover` find_app_container: Coolify labels first; name=congress-app- fallback RUNNING only (never start stopped manual relics). Rollout: docs/rollouts/2026-08-10-box-disk-hygiene.md. Branch `grok/box-disk-hygiene`.


- **[GROK3] Coolify prod vs CI split (owner direction, 2026-07-22) — PLANNED / NOTED.** Keep on Coolify prod host (`host.jays.services` / <HETZNER_IP_RETIRED>): ST prod + Garage (+ optional 1 small Actions runner). Move fuller CI/actions (congress-ci, usage-ci, shared-ci, heavy verify) onto a separate host so backup LTX listing / ST deploys are not starved. Current co-tenants: garage healthy, 5 runners (congress-deploy, socratic-deploy, usage-ci, shared-ci, congress-ci), Coolify stack; disk 67%/75G; ST deploy was at 60% CPU during probe. No runner migration executed this turn.

- **Usage Monitor Garage backup and Coolify disk external alerting (CODEX, 2026-07-18) — COMPLETED / LIVE VERIFIED.** Extended the existing singleton `fleet-sentry-monitor` with authenticated 15-minute Garage LTX/restore-plan checks, scheduler-aware age enforcement, Coolify Garage health/disk thresholds, and a weekly full-integrity scratch restore. Two scheduled Sentry Cron check-ins and the first full restore/cleanup passed. No new daemon, DNS, writer authority, production database, credential, or backup-object mutation.
- **Fleet-wide unfinished-effort inventory and parallel closeout (CODEX, owner-directed 2026-07-18) — IN PROGRESS.** Auditing all five live boards against current branches/PRs/deploy evidence, publishing a definitive unfinished/not-started list, and delegating independent non-colliding closeout lanes to low-cost agent teams. Existing KEEPOUTs and dirty worktrees are preserved; active Socratic.Trade server-stats reliability remains the local critical path.
- **Push pipeline RECEIVE path (CLAUDE) — BLOCKED on owner.** Slack app Event Subscriptions not
  enabled, so zero inbound events reach the relay (events.jsonl never created; daemon log =
  hello only). Owner action: app config -> Event Subscriptions -> enable + bot event
  message.channels -> save. Then CLAUDE switches fleet reads from the 20s poller to the relay
  and updates hook + docs (existing pending task).
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): re-verified and re-flagged — consumer.mjs relay is
  fleet-declared PRIMARY (AGENT-SYNC.md line 185-191, PRIMARY/polling fallback) but delivers ZERO
  inbound messages, so AG and CURSOR consumers are silently blind. Two live consumer.mjs procs
  confirmed (AG pid running since 11:47AM, CURSOR since 01:51AM per `ps aux`);
  `/Users/jay/apps/agent-sync/events.jsonl` does not exist (`ls` exit=1); daemon log has zero
  "event:" lines. CURSOR posted Slack sync-4/sync-5 claiming "Receiving realtime" via relay — this
  is FALSE. Silent coordination loss in progress. action=mark-blocked; reassigned
  CLAUDE (relay)/CODEX (config row) -> CLAUDE for the consolidated fix — see the sharpened Planned

Listener is up from this session.


- **2026-08-16 — GROK — COMPLETED/LIVE — Scheduled jobs operational when triggered.**  Cleared stale janitor (Aug 11) + shepherd (Jul 14) locks; both steal >2h leftovers.  Watch keeps timers loaded (no idle kickstart; never ios-ship-now / com.PM2).  Hetzner cron retargeted to live `<HETZNER_SERVER_ID>` / `nbg1-dc3`.  Coordinator PR #39 merged.

- **[FLEET][GROK] Finish Monet Mac-storage prune of leftover worktrees — COMPLETED 2026-08-15.** Monet had already removed 45 ST trees (~50 GB) then hit weekly cap. This session inventoried ST/CT/UM/fleet/DealDex/Personal/CTS by GitHub PR state (not merge-base — squash-merge rewrites SHAs). Preserved remaining real diffs under `~/apps/_preserved-patches/`. Removed ~150 disposable worktrees (merged PRs, closed dups, vendor-bin noise, missing /tmp). Kept 5 live ST PR lanes + 2 UM open-PR trees + each app's main checkout. `~/apps` 50 GB → 5.1 GB. Free 76 GB → 138 GB. Did not rebase live PR lanes. Did not apply uncommitted functional patches (owner ask below). CT unused `processing` UIBackgroundModes is already gone from source; App Store `INVALID_BINARY` was the old 1.0.7 attach, already replaced with 1.0.14 (`PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`).

- **2026-08-14 — GROK — COMPLETED — Two spaces after every sentence, including App Store review notes (live `~/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` + `FLEET-UI-COPY.md`; coordinator PR `grok/two-spaces-rule`).**  Owner: applies everywhere forever.  CT App Store listing also rewritten (2-week trial, Executive Branch).

- **Mac hard-drive cleanup audit and reversible space recovery (CODEX, 2026-07-18) — DONE.** Removed inactive `~/.npm/_npx` ephemeral package caches (about 1.46 GiB); Xcode regenerated about 610 MiB of DerivedData after cleanup. Preserved active Codex runtime cache, repositories, worktrees, snapshots, and personal files. Data volume verified at 113 GiB available, up from 87 GiB at audit start.
- **Self-hosted CI offload: resource-guarded runners + CT_CI_RUNNER switch (MONET, owner-directed, M) — DONE 2026-07-17.** Motivation: July hosted-Actions overage $166.51 through the 16th (ST 26,492 min / CT 4,329 / AUM 1,840 / shared 441; billing usage API, user scope). Coolify `github-runner` service (uuid uhz1yhxevabvbf9eblxo4t8z, Hetzner box shared with socratic-trade-prod) updated from 2 to 4 runner containers, all on myoung34/github-runner:2.335.1-ubuntu-noble: existing congress-deploy + socratic-deploy (unchanged labels/names, now cpu_shares 512 / cpus 2.5 / mem 2560m / oom_score_adj 500) plus NEW congress-ci + socratic-ci (cpu_shares 256 / cpus 2.5 / mem 2048m / oom_score_adj 600) — CI always yields to prod under CPU contention and the kernel OOM-kills runners before prod. Limits verified present in Coolify's canonical generated compose; all 4 runners online in GitHub; ST prod healthy through the redeploy. Congress.Trade PR #518 (merged b6dc068): both ci.yml jobs `runs-on: (github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]' && vars.CT_CI_RUNNER) || 'ubuntu-latest'` + workflow_dispatch; dependabot carve-out per codex-connector P1 (third-party install scripts never run beside prod/PAT). Repo var CT_CI_RUNNER=congress-ci SET — CT CI now runs on the box; verified live: main run 29558627259 both jobs SUCCESS on coolify-hetzner-congress-ci (2.6 + 0.9 min, on par with hosted), ST prod ok during. RUNBOOK: runner down / PRs queueing → `gh variable set CT_CI_RUNNER --body ""` (instant hosted fallback). NOT done (follow-up): ST verify offload (the $142/mo prize) — socratic-ci runner is provisioned+online but ST's Playwright/browser deps on the runner image are unvalidated; wire ST's workflow only after a proving run. CodeQL/gitleaks/uptime stay hosted deliberately (memory-hungry or trivial). Deploy lanes untouched.
- **Mac disk space optimization and worktree cleanup (AG, S) — DONE 2026-07-10.** Optimized cleanup-worktrees.sh, force-removed blocked worktrees after safe inspection of untracked files, pruned merged worktrees, and cleaned up package manager caches, saving 4.0 GiB of disk space.
- **Enable consumer.mjs off-machine monitoring via wss://agent-sync.jays.services fallback (AG, S) — DONE 2026-07-10.** Allow consumer.mjs to fall back to the public Cloudflare tunnel WebSocket if local port 8787 is unreachable.
- **Bot / approval-agent review-gate audit (CODEX, read-only) — DONE 2026-07-08.**
  Audited open PR review/check/thread state across Socratic.Trade, Congress.Trade,
  congress-trading-shared, and API-usage-monitor after the required-conversation-resolution
  rule landed. Result: most open PR blockers are merge conflicts (`DIRTY`), draft state, or real
  failing checks, not approval-agent noise. Three unresolved bot-created review threads are live
  gates: Socratic.Trade #1104 has a Cursor Bugbot thread about singleton Congress client env-cache
  behavior; #1117 has a likely valid Codex thread about `__rotate__` model precheck with non-OpenAI
  keys; #989 has a low-signal Copilot trailing-whitespace thread.
  Codex usage-limit comments appear on several PRs and create noise, but do not create unresolved
  review threads. Recommended action: owners/authors address #1117 in code, resolve or mechanically
  fix #989's whitespace thread, triage #1104 with the owning branch, and avoid treating Codex
  usage-limit comments as merge blockers.
- **agent-sync push pipeline, SEND path (CODEX + CLAUDE, 2026-07-05).** pm2 `agent-sync-push`
  (Slack Socket Mode via SLACK_SYNC_WEBSOCKET; local relay ws://127.0.0.1:8787; authenticated
  tunnel POST endpoint https://agent-sync.jays.services/post behind AGENT_SYNC_POST_TOKEN —
  rotated once after an argv-exposure concern, smoke-tested local+tunnel). Slack bot token never
  leaves the Mac.
- **Seat-identity system v4 (CLAUDE, owner-settled 2026-07-05).** AGENT_SEAT env pin (this app:
  Claude) > owner-in-conversation > default CLAUDE; no inference from any local state; codified

- **Enable Slack Event Subscriptions so the relay receive path goes live (OWNER, S)** — toggle +
  subscribe bot event message.channels on the agent-sync Slack app; everything downstream is armed.
- **Switch fleet reads from poller to relay once inbound events flow (CLAUDE, S)** — flip the
  session-hook watcher to tail events.jsonl / consumer.mjs; retire poller loops as fallback-only.
- **Fix Codex silent-message-loss: relay-primary config before inbound works (CLAUDE, S)** —
  ~/.codex/AGENTS.md points Codex at consumer.mjs as primary while the relay delivers nothing;
  make poller/Slack-API primary until Event Subscriptions is live.

  one-pass-exit/pm2-restart design producing a 500+ restart counter that masks real crash loops.
- **Expose Slack-connection health on /health and probe it from fleet-sentry-monitor (CLAUDE, S)** —
  slack_connected, last_event_ts, last_post_ts on agent-sync-push; monitor.py curls it.
- **Harden /post: rate limit, local audit log, per-agent attribution (MONET, M)** — token-bucket
  (~10 posts/min), append accepted posts to posts.jsonl with caller attribution.
- **Write the AGENT_SYNC_POST_TOKEN rotation runbook (CLAUDE, S)** — holders, rotation steps,
  smoke test, where the secret lives on each side.
- **Fix AGENT-SYNC.md internal drift from today's multi-agent edits (CURSOR, S)** — garbled
  SENDER-registry sentence, poller-vs-relay section contradictions, stale entrypoint names.
- **Standardize seat-identity + read-mechanism across Codex/Gemini global configs (CURSOR, S)** —
  give ~/.codex/AGENTS.md and ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md the equivalent of the v4 seat line.
- **Investigate trading-codex PM2 crash history — 1623 restarts (CURSOR, S)** — post-build .next

- **Finish consumer.mjs standardization: rotation, staleness detection, inbox convention (CLAUDE, M)** —
  events.jsonl rotation policy; consumer replays whole file on start today.
  _2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3): reassigned CODEX -> CLAUDE (Codex quota-capped to Jul 8 18:10 CT).
  Verified: `consumer.mjs` `replayLocalEvents()` reads the entire `events.jsonl` every start with no
  rotation/staleness guard. action=reassign-now._
- **Bootstrap fleet-infra effort board (CLAUDE, S)** — DONE 2026-07-05 (this file); registry row
  added to EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md; row kept for the issues-mirror-exemption decision record.

### 2026-07-05 audit cycle-3
_Added by CLAUDE audit-c3 pass. Tags: CURSOR / CODEX / AG / MONET / CLAUDE / OWNER. Assignments are
reservations, not locks — re-negotiate in #agent-sync. NEVER assign to CODEX (quota-capped to
Jul 8 18:10 CT)._

- **Flip fleet read-mechanism docs+configs to poller-PRIMARY until Event Subscriptions is enabled (CLAUDE, S)** — AGENT-SYNC.md declares the relay PRIMARY but events.jsonl is never created, so every consumer.mjs (AG, CURSOR live now) silently receives nothing. Until the owner enables Slack Event Subscriptions, make the stdlib poller (agent-sync-poll.py loop) the documented PRIMARY read path in AGENT-SYNC.md, ~/.codex/AGENTS.md, and ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md, and add a one-line 'relay currently receive-dead' banner. Broader than the Codex-only board row and fixable today by a non-capped agent.
- **Add a relay-liveness self-check to consumer.mjs that warns when no inbound events have ever arrived (CLAUDE, S)** — consumer.mjs connects to the relay and prints nothing indefinitely when events.jsonl is absent/empty, giving false 'attached=working' confidence (CURSOR literally claimed 'Receiving realtime' while blind). On connect, if events.jsonl is missing or its newest ts is older than N minutes, emit a loud 'RELAY RECEIVE-DEAD — fall back to poller' warning to stderr so agents don't silently miss coordination.
- **Expose slack_connected/last_event_ts/last_post_ts on agent-sync-push /health and alert on inbound-starvation (CLAUDE, S)** — The /health endpoint currently returns only {ok, service}, so an armed-but-starved receive path (hello-only, zero events) looks healthy. Surface last inbound event ts and Slack socket state; have fleet-sentry-monitor curl it and warn when the socket is connected but no events have arrived for >T. Overlaps a board row (CLAUDE) but that row predates confirming events.jsonl is entirely absent — sharpen it to include inbound-starvation detection, not just connection state.
- **Add a startup health line to fleet-sentry-monitor identifying its own restarts as by-design (CURSOR, S)** — restart_counts in state.json shows fleet-sentry-monitor=798 which reads as a crash loop to any casual pm2 inspection; the single-pass-exit design is documented only in the .py header. Until the CURSOR internal-loop conversion lands, emit a breadcrumb/context field marking the monitor's own restart count as expected, so its self-check-in and pm2 counter aren't mistaken for a fault.

## Changelog of this log
- 2026-07-05 — bootstrapped by CLAUDE (next-wave cycle 2); seeded from the fleet-infra analysis
  (stale corrections applied on the TRADING board where those rows live).
- 2026-07-05 (CLAUDE audit-c3) - Audit cycle-3 pass: re-verified and re-flagged the consumer.mjs
  relay receive-dead hazard (still true — zero inbound events, AG+CURSOR consumers silently blind,
  CURSOR's "Receiving realtime" Slack claim confirmed false). Added 5 new ABANDONED/HANGING rows
  documenting the gap between agent Slack "DONE" claims and actual gh PR state (Codex readiness
  DONE-local/unpushed; Socratic.Trade #853/#856 still OPEN; congress-trading-shared #54/#55/#56
  still OPEN; Congress.Trade #181/#182 still OPEN). Reassigned four CODEX-owned Planned rows off
  Codex (quota-capped to Jul 8 18:10 CT): relay-primary config -> CLAUDE, consumer.mjs
  standardization -> CLAUDE, trading-codex PM2 crash-history investigation -> CURSOR (verified
  low-value: counter climbing but process stable, app-level import aborts not a crash loop).
  Added 4 new Planned rows under "2026-07-05 audit cycle-3": poller-primary docs flip (CLAUDE),
  consumer.mjs relay-liveness self-check (CLAUDE), /health inbound-starvation exposure (CLAUDE),
  fleet-sentry-monitor by-design-restart breadcrumb (CURSOR).

## Branch protection standardized (CLAUDE, owner-directed 2026-07-05)
- **DONE 2026-07-05.** Owner directed branch protection + conversation-resolution ON for all repos.
  Applied classic branch protection (enforce_admins=true, required_conversation_resolution=true,
  required checks) to the three that lacked it/checks: api-usage-monitor (verify,gitleaks),
  congress-trading-shared (verify), Congress.Trade (typecheck+test,gitleaks); Socratic.Trade already
  had it (ruleset verify + classic conv/admins). Verified no docs-PR deadlock (verify runs on
  docs-only PRs on both newly-protected repos). Owner also appointed CLAUDE cross-platform fleet
  coordinator (strict/critical/diligent/firm mandate). Codified in AGENT-SYNC.md (Merge requirements
  + Coordinator authority). Broadcast sync-33.

- **2026-07-18 22:04 CDT — CLAUDE — CI-cost audit closeout (read-only receipt).** Verified the MONET
  07-17 handoff's billing plan state: ST + Congress.Trade are now 100% self-hosted (every workflow job
  on socratic-ci/socratic-deploy/trading-live/congress-ci/congress-deploy labels; no ubuntu-latest on
  either main); July MTD Actions overage flat at ~$184.04 since 07-16 (+$0.004) — offload stopped the
  bleeding (day-by-day sub-table had an unreconciled attribution artifact; re-pull in ~2 days for a
  conclusive receipt). $0 spending cap NOT yet fleet-safe: Usage-Monitor (verify/gitleaks/CodeQL) and
  congress-trading-shared (verify) required checks still on ubuntu-latest → cap = merge lockout there
  once included minutes exhaust. GitHub billing adapter code DONE (UM PR #398, user scope); remaining:
  owner adds GitHub provider row in UM /settings with Plan:read PAT. Posted MONET's pending CI-billing
  closeout to #agent-sync on their behalf (ts 1784430250). Follow-up task chip spawned for UM+shared
  runner offload.

- **2026-07-19 00:55 CDT — CLAUDE — UM+shared self-hosted CI offload: wiring DELIVERED (dormant),
  infra half BLOCKED on P1 Coolify outage.** Usage-Monitor PR #583 + congress-trading-shared PR #198
  gate all previously-hosted jobs behind `vars.UM_CI_RUNNER`/`vars.SHARED_CI_RUNNER` with dependabot
  carve-out (oracle-production-deploy.yml + codex-autofix-reusable.yml deliberately untouched/hosted);
  both PRs green on hosted, HELD OPEN un-merged pending prove-before-flip. BLOCKER (CORRECTED 2026-07-19 15:41 CDT, CLAUDE): originally logged as a "Coolify API outage / P1".
  That was WRONG and is retracted. Coolify is HEALTHY — /api/health returns 200 and unauthenticated
  /api/v1/version returns 401, i.e. a correctly-functioning API. The real, much narrower issue is that
  THIS AGENT'S MCP client cannot authenticate to it (401, now failing to connect at all) — an
  agent-side credential/config problem, not a service outage and not a fleet blocker. I also wrongly
  attributed the day's GitHub runner flapping to it; runners recovered on their own with nobody
  touching Coolify (Congress 3/3, Socratic 3/3 healthy). Root cause of the instability was host load
  average 123 from concurrent agent test suites → `usage-ci`/`shared-ci` runner containers NOT added,
  no vars set, existing 4 runners untouched. OWNER: regenerate a Coolify API token (UI) and update MCP
  config + /Users/jay/.secrets/ copy. Resume sequence + residual $0-cap losses recorded in #agent-sync
  ts 1784447320. Once #583/#198 land post-proving, the $0 Actions cap is merge-safe fleet-wide.
