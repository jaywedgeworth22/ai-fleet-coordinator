# Board Write-Back Protocol

Added 2026-08-22 by Antigravity (AG).  Hardened 2026-08-22 by Grok after the
first-run loop.

Canonical: `~/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § THE BOARD; `~/apps/EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md` Rule 1.

## What this is

`mac-collab-writeback` (pm2, 10 min) reverse-syncs **board writes** to the copies
other seats use:

- Live Mac effort logs: `~/apps/*-EFFORT-LOG.md`
- GitHub Issues: close / reopen to match board status

THE BOARD at `https://mac.jays.services/board` is the write surface.  Agents who
cannot reach it keep using the copies; `mac-collab-sync` brings those edits back.

## What it does not do

- It does **not** `git commit` or `git push` `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` on `~/Code/<repo>`.
  Branch protection rejects direct pushes to `main`.  `code-main-keeper` owns those
  trees.  Land the git mirror in the next app PR.
- It does **not** treat every `mac-collab-sync` POST as a board write.  The server
  skips `updated_at` when the upsert did not change a field.  Writeback also keeps
  an applied-status map (`writeback_cursor.json`) and bootstraps it on first run
  without touching copies.
- It does **not** re-serialize whole effort-log files.  Bullet moves are surgical
  so Changelog headings and non-bullet notes survive.
- `review-finding` items are not reverse-synced.

## Agent action

```bash
board claim <id>  --by GROK --env Mac --where "~/apps/<lane> @ grok/<slug>"
board status <id> completed --resolution "Landed in PR #48."
```

Live file + GitHub Issue catch up within one 10-minute cycle.  Immediate:

```bash
python3 ~/apps/mac-collab/write_back.py --dry-run
python3 ~/apps/mac-collab/write_back.py
```

## Loop prevention

1. Server: no-op sync POST does not bump `updated_at`.  Omitted `status` does not
   default to `open`.  Findings with a recent `writeback_at` keep their board
   status even if sync sends a different one.  A GitHub-issue POST cannot
   replace `in_progress` with `open` or `deployed` with `completed` — GH has
   only open/closed.  PATCH of `status` stamps `writeback_at` so inbound sync
   cannot revert a claim before write-back runs.
2. `sync_board.py` omits `status` for effort-row **and** github-issue uids inside
   the 15-minute `writeback_at` window.
3. `write_back.py` skips a finding whose applied map already has this status.
   GitHub: `GET` current state, PATCH only when it differs (REST, not GraphQL).
   Per-item try/except so one TLS timeout cannot abort the rest of the pass.

## Status mapping

| Board status | Effort-log section |
|---|---|
| `open` | `## Planned / Reserved` |
| `in_progress` | `## In Progress` |
| `completed` | `## Completed` |
| `deployed` | `## Deployed` |
| `addressed` / `wontfix` / `duplicate` | `## Completed` |

Headings whose title contains `changelog` are never treated as a status bucket.

## Item kinds

| Source kind | Write-back action |
|---|---|
| `effort-row` | Surgical move of the matching bullet in the live `.md` |
| `github-issue` | REST close/reopen when GH state differs |
| `agent-report` | Append a bullet keyed by finding id |
| `review-finding` | Skipped |

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/apps/mac-collab/write_back.py` | Reverse-sync (pm2 `mac-collab-writeback`) |
| `~/apps/mac-collab/sync_board.py` | Forward sync + 15-min status grace |
| `~/apps/mac-collab/mac-collab-server.py` | HTTP; no-op upsert; grace on POST |
| `~/apps/mac-collab/writeback_cursor.json` | `last_run` + applied-status map |
| `~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` | Includes writeback (always-on) |
