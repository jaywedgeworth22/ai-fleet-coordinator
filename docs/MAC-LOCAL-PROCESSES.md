# Mac local processes (owner machine)

**This is the master list.**  Every always-on job, scheduled job, login item,
and installed helper script that agents create on Jay's Mac lives here.
Not Coolify.  Not GitHub-hosted runners.  Not a one-shot `npm exec` from an

Last inventory: Wed, Sep 2, 2026 9:42pm CT (Antigravity).  Booted out `com.jay.botfleet-imessage-relay` after an infinite echo loop between Jay's account and the `agents` account (sending outgoing iMessages to HOUSEKEEPER and triggering macOS send sounds every 15s).  Prior 6:40pm CT (Claude).  Added fleet-recall Claude Code hooks, the `fleet-recall` stdio MCP row, and the Oracle RAG routines.  Prior 2:45pm CT (Claude).  `com.jay.botfleet-server` now runs from `~/apps/botfleet-server` (detached `origin/main` worktree) instead of the stale `botfleet-grok` lane, and `~/apps/update-botfleet.sh` builds from that checkout and restarts the harness.  Prior inventory, Sep 2 (Grok): Idle unload **36h → 12h** (`GROK_IDLE_UNLOAD_HOURS`; `/resume` reloads tools).  Prior 11:30pm: added hourly `com.jay.grok-idle-unload` (session/close live Grok chats; transcripts kept).  Hetzner swap target 16GiB + swappiness 20.  Prior 10:40pm: `com.jay.botfleet-imessage-relay` is **Up** (12 bot chats mapped; log no longer doubled).  Earlier 8:40pm: added on-demand `~/apps/fleet-rag/recall` + `scripts/install-fleet-rag.sh`.  Corrected com.jay.botfleet-imessage-relay: LaunchAgent missing/unloaded, not Up.  Added `com.jay.mac-resource-watch` (every 5 min, disk/RAM/CPU → cleanup + Housekeeper webhook).  Janitor warn 80G / pressure 65G.  Disk janitor now walks all fleet Code repos (was ST/CT/CTS only), protects unsuffixed standing lanes + runtimes, reaps clean kimi-named / nested / `/tmp` trees, and uses 2-day idle when free < 50G.  Live `~/.claude-disk-janitor/janitor.sh`; tracked `scripts/disk-janitor.sh`.  `mac-collab-writeback` is in the ecosystem (15 pm2 apps) and watch expected list.  Hardened after the first-run loop (updated_at from sync POSTs → gh close/reopen of ~1700 issues/cycle; lossy md re-render).  Writeback now bootstraps an applied-status map, edits live logs surgically, uses REST + current-state check for Issues, and does not git-commit `~/Code/<repo>`.  Tracked copies: `ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/mac-process-watch.sh` + `scripts/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` + `scripts/mac-collab/write_back.py` + `scripts/grok-leader.sh` + `scripts/mac-status.sh` + `scripts/disk-janitor.sh`.  Command of record: `bash ~/apps/mac-status.sh`.
**pm2 `grok-leader`** is the shared Grok backend (`~/.grok/leader.sock`).  **pm2 `grok-acp`** is
`127.0.0.1:12419` for Conductor new sessions (`--no-leader serve` — `--leader serve`
does not bind).  Shellular Grok + new TUI join the leader.  List/load:
`python3 ~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/leader-client.py list`.
Slack inbox is multi-seat (`com.jay.slack-agent-inbox`).
Scout uses local `http://127.0.0.1:8899/fetch-ptr` (same session as
production).  `com.PM2` re-bootstrapped.  Claude remote-control up.
Ecosystem: `~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs`.  Status: `bash ~/apps/mac-status.sh`.
Down/restart log: `~/Library/Logs/mac-process-watch.log`.  Watch times out `pm2 jlist` at 8s (wedged RPC used to hang the whole 120s loop), resurrects God if needed, and kills Shellular if the process is up but the cloud relay is dead (1006 / handshake).  Also expects `grok-leader` + `mac-collab` + `mac-collab-sync`.  When 3+ jobs are missing, watch **resurrects only if the dump still lists the expected names**; a one-job leftover dump is treated as poison and watch runs `pm2 start ~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` then `pm2 save`.  Watch restarts
always-on jobs (pm2 resurrect / ecosystem start, launchd kickstart/bootstrap)
and keeps scheduled timers **loaded** (does not kickstart idle).  Steals
stale disk-janitor / merge-shepherd run-locks older than 2h.  4-per-hour
backoff.  `MAC_PROCESS_WATCH_RESTART=0` is log-only.

**How to read the Kind column**

- **Always-on** — supposed to stay up across logout/reboot (KeepAlive or a
  login resurrect).  If it is down, that is a bug unless the row says Disabled.
- **Scheduled** — launchd/cron fires it; it is not a long-lived daemon.
- **On-demand** — installed helper.  Agents run it by hand.  It must not linger.

---

## Binding rule (every agent, every platform, forever)

If you **create, change, load, bootout, or retire** any of the following, you
**must** update this file **and** the Apple Note in the same change
(`~/apps/apple-notes-coding.sh --update "⭐️ Background Jobs Master List"`
— prefer `--update` on that exact title; do not mint a second note):

- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` (and `/Library/LaunchAgents` /
  `LaunchDaemons` if you touch those)
- `crontab` / login items
- `pm2` KeepAlive jobs (`pm2 start` / `delete` / `save`)
- Any helper script under `~/apps`, `~/.claude-*`, `~/vision-worker`,
  `~/actions-runner`, or similar that other agents are expected to run

Do **not** add a process "just for this session" and leave it.  If it survives
logout or reboot, it belongs here.  If you retire one, mark it **Retired** —
do not delete the row.

Cloud / no-Mac agents: do not invent LaunchAgents.  Describe the job in the
PR and leave a Mac seat to install + list it.

Never register a daemon from `~/.npm/_npx/…`.  `mac-auto-cleanup.sh` wipes
that tree and the job crash-loops (Shellular did this 42,703× on 2026-08-13).
Install to `~/apps/<tool>-runtime` instead.

## Fleet recovery lessons (read before touching pm2)

Written after the **2026-08-21 total-degradation incident** (Grok restore, Claude
root-cause).  The Mac did **not** run out of disk (~108GB free) — it ran out of CPU
and RAM on a 16GB box, and then a poisoned pm2 dump kept the fleet from coming back.

**Memory, not disk, is what takes this box down.**  Load hit ~800 with swap at
12.4GB/14.3GB and ~400k pageouts.  `JetsamEvent-2026-08-21-021055` shows the memory
killer firing with Cursor Helper Renderer as the largest process, alongside
`shutdown_stall_2026-08-21-020046` and two dirty reboots (01:58, 02:04) with no
`.panic` file.  Under that pressure every stdio MCP server times out at 30s, the pm2
God RPC wedges, and jobs crash-loop — none of which is the individual job's fault.
Check `sysctl vm.swapusage` and `uptime` **before** debugging any single service.

**`pm2 kill` and `pm2 save` write the LIVE list over `~/.pm2/dump.pm2`.**  If the live
list is a subset, the dump is poisoned and `pm2 resurrect` can never restore the rest.
That is what happened: a DeepSeek `dsh`/`npx` session in `~/Code/Congress.Trade` started
a fresh God holding only `vision-worker` at 00:35, and the 01:05 and 01:40 kills wrote
that one-job list over the dump.  **Never `pm2 save` unless `pm2 list` shows the full 14
jobs**, and never save from a one-off `npx`/`dsh` session.  The previous good list
survives in `~/.pm2/dump.pm2.bak` — copy it aside before any pm2 surgery
(`~/.pm2/dump.pm2.golden-14apps.20260821` is the 2026-08-21 snapshot).

**`pm2 start` does NOT re-read `env` from the ecosystem file.**  pm2 caches an app's
environment on first start and replays it forever.  On 2026-08-21 Shellular crash-looped
on `/bin/sh: ioreg: command not found` — `node-machine-id` shells out to
`ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice` — because the cached PATH had no `/usr/sbin`,
even though `pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` sets `/usr/sbin:/sbin` correctly.  Editing the
config alone changes nothing.  Use `pm2 restart <app> --update-env`, or
`pm2 delete <app> && pm2 start "$ECOSYSTEM" --only <app>`.  Verify against the LIVE env,
never the file: `pm2 jlist` → `pm2_env.env.PATH`.

**Two pm2 installs shadow each other.**  `/usr/local/bin/pm2` (7.0.1, node 24) precedes
`/opt/homebrew/bin/pm2` (7.0.3, node 26) on PATH, which yields "In-memory PM2 is
out-of-date" and a CLI that cannot drive the running God.  Prefer the explicit
`/opt/homebrew/bin/pm2`, or run `pm2 update` — but note `pm2 update` restarts every job
from the CURRENT dump, so confirm the dump is not poisoned first.

**`mac-process-watch.sh` cannot recover a poisoned dump.**  When 3+ jobs are missing it
runs `pm2 resurrect` only, and never falls through to
`pm2 start "$ECOSYSTEM" --only <name>` the way the one/two-missing path does.  Combined
with the 4-restarts/hour backoff, the watch then stops even attempting the useless
resurrect — which is why nothing self-healed overnight.  **Open follow-up:** make the
bulk path verify the expected names actually came back and start any stragglers from the
ecosystem file, and skip dump-on-kill when the live list is a subset.

**All 15 jobs are already in `~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs`**, `mac-collab-sync`
and `mac-collab-writeback` included — so recovery never needs a hand-rolled
`pm2 start`.  Restore with `pm2 start ~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` and only
then `pm2 save`.

**`grok-leader` vs a live Grok TUI:** if `/usr/sbin/lsof ~/.grok/leader.sock` shows a `grok-*` TUI holding the socket, **`pm2 stop grok-leader`** (not `pm2 kill`).  `mac-process-watch` skips restart while that socket is bound (`SKIP pm2:grok-leader lock-held`) and `pm2 stop`s an `errored` storm.  Bare `lsof` is a no-op when PATH lacks `/usr/sbin` (LaunchAgent 2026-08-21: 355 restarts).  `leader.sh` exits 75 when the lock is held; ecosystem `stop_exit_codes: [75]`.  Leaving the pm2 job `errored` burns CPU on a restart storm.  Start pm2 `grok-leader` again only after the TUI exits and the socket is free.  Do not `pm2 kill` the whole daemon to "fix" a lock conflict.

**`~/.pm2/pm2.log` grows unbounded** — it reached **230MB** by 2026-08-21, which makes
every read of it slow.  Read it with `grep -a … | tail`, and rotate it when it gets big.

**Agent worktrees belong in `~/apps/*`, never `~/Code/*`.**  `code-main-keeper` (pm2,
every ~60s) deliberately returns every top-level `~/Code/*` checkout to `origin/main` —
those trees are the human review / integration base, so "open in Xcode" always builds
the landed product.  On a non-main branch with a clean tree it soft-checkouts main and
fast-forwards.  It is safe by design (never hard-resets, never force-checkouts, never
discards commits absent from `origin/main`), but a worktree created at
`~/Code/<repo>-<seat>` jumps back to main the moment your tree goes clean, which reads
exactly like lost work if you have not pushed yet.  Push early, and put the worktree
under `~/apps/`.

## Always-on (supposed to stay up)

Live-checked Fri, Aug 21, 2026 ~2:25am CT.

| Name | Kind | What it is | Live now |
|---|---|---|---|
| `com.jay.claude-remote-control` | Always-on | Phone / claude.ai steering.  Monet / Renoir / Claude all look like `claude`.  Do not SIGKILL because you see no TTY.  `WorkingDirectory` in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jay.claude-remote-control.plist` is the default directory new remote/mobile chats start in — changed 2026-09-01 from `/Users/jay/Code/Socratic.Trade` to `/Users/jay/Code` (bare `/Users/jay` throws "Workspace not trusted"; `/Users/jay/Code` is trust-accepted).  Edit that key + `launchctl bootout gui/501/com.jay.claude-remote-control` + `launchctl bootstrap gui/501 <plist>` to repoint it. | **Up** (reloaded 2026-09-01, now serving from `/Users/jay/Code`) |

Public `acp.jays.services` is Cloudflare Access on Usage.Jays.Services (org `silent-frost-37e0.cloudflareaccess.com`, app `e76661ba-1d68-4688-a7ff-9fca47e41939`).

Origin has no app token (stdio-to-ws returns 426).  Phone/Conductor still uses Shellular. | **Up** |
| **Python `seat-mcp`** | Always-on (session today; not pm2) | `127.0.0.1:8793` only (`python3 -m seat_mcp` via `~/apps/seat-mcp/start.sh`).  Public `agents.jays.services` on named tunnel `Jay's Tunnel` (ingress v9 → `http://127.0.0.1:8793`).

| **pm2 `grok-leader`** | Always-on when socket free | Shared Grok backend.  `~/.grok/bin/grok agent --always-approve leader --no-exit-on-disconnect`.  Socket `~/.grok/leader.sock`.  Shellular and new TUI (`[cli] use_leader = true`) attach here so a phone/bot can `session/list` + `session/load` local chats.  Added 2026-08-18.  `leader.sh` exits 75 when the socket is already bound; ecosystem `stop_exit_codes: [75]`. | **Stopped 2026-08-21 18:11 CT** — this TUI (pid 12360) spawned leader pid 76260 at 15:43.  355 restarts then `errored` because watch lock-held used bare `lsof` and launchd PATH had no `/usr/sbin`.  `pm2 stop grok-leader`.  Watch now uses `/usr/sbin/lsof`.  `pm2 start grok-leader` after TUI exits. |
| **pm2 `dsh-web`** | Always-on | DeepSeek Harness browser UI on `127.0.0.1:3080`.  Tailscale Serve `https://macbook.boa-roygbiv.ts.net:3080` (tailnet only, no Funnel).  Start: `~/apps/dsh-runtime/start-web.sh`.  Serve: `~/apps/dsh-runtime/serve-tailscale.sh`.  **Never `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh`.**  Added 2026-09-01. | **Up** |

Native `~/.grok/bin/grok agent --always-approve --no-leader serve`.  `start.sh` sets `GROK_HOME` to `acp-home/` (stripped config, no plugins, Claude/Cursor MCPs off, `[ui] permission_mode = always-approve`) so Conductor sessions do not load the TUI kitchen sink.  `acp-client.py --mcp-server NAME` expands names from user `~/.grok/config.toml`.  Empty list = no MCPs.  Client auto-approves `session/request_permission` from offered allow options and implements ACP `terminal/*`.  TUI / grok-leader keep `~/.grok`.  **Never bind `:2419`**.  `--leader serve` does not listen.  Token in `~/.secrets/grok-acp.env` (never print).  Added 2026-08-18.  Per-session MCP pick 2026-08-29.  Permission + terminals 2026-08-30. | **Up** |
| **pm2 `xcode-health`** | Always-on | `127.0.0.1:8791`.  Public `xcode.jays.services`.  Moved off launchd 2026-08-16.  **Orphan-holds-port self-heal (2026-08-21, Cursor):** `_bind_or_reclaim()` matches mac-collab — on `EADDRINUSE` SIGTERM a holder only when it is another `xcode-health-server.py` that fails an 8s `/health` probe (SIGKILL after 15s); a healthy sibling or any other process is left alone and the start exits 3.  The 2026-08-21 degradation had this job at 2678 restarts against an orphan that was still serving 200. | **Up** — `/health` 200 (pm2-owned) |
| **pm2 `mac-collab`** | Always-on | `127.0.0.1:8792`.  Public `mac.jays.services` (THE BOARD + markdown `/files`).  Token `~/.secrets/mac-collab.env`.  **Does not serve `global-api-keys`.** Names-only: `GET /files/key-names`. Timing-safe compare + 401 rate limit. `board show/status` accepts unique 8-char id prefixes. Live `~/apps/MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES.md` on the allowlist. Autorotate board synced. | **Up** — `/health` 200 (orphan held `:8792` twice on 2026-08-20: 1:09am, and 19:50-22:06 which crash-looped pm2 ~24k times into a 28MB error log; rotated to `mac-collab-error.log.20260820-eaddrinuse-loop.gz`) |
| **pm2 `mac-collab-sync`** | Always-on | Board reconciler (effort logs + GitHub issues → mac-collab).  Not the HTTP server.  Also snapshots `~/apps/mac-collab/findings.db` to `~/apps/mac-collab/backups/findings-YYYYMMDD.db` (14-day keep).  Runs can overlap: seen 2 concurrent on 2026-08-20 because `gh issue list` calls were hitting their 60s timeout (`network is unreachable`) and a run outlived the interval.  Not the cause of that day's outage, but it doubles the POST load on the board server. | **Up** |
| **pm2 `mac-collab-writeback`** | Always-on | **Reverse-sync: board writes → live effort-log files + GitHub Issues.**  Surgical bullet moves in `~/apps/*-EFFORT-LOG.md`; REST close/reopen of Issues only when GH state differs.  Does **not** git-commit `~/Code/<repo>` (branch protection; Code trees are the integration base).  Trigger is an applied-status map plus `updated_at` (server no longer bumps `updated_at` on no-op sync POSTs).  First pass bootstraps the map and writes nothing.  Grace: stamps `writeback_at`; sync omits `status` for 15 min (effort-row **and** github-issue).  Cursor: `~/apps/mac-collab/writeback_cursor.json`.  Script: `~/apps/mac-collab/write_back.py --loop`.  In ecosystem (Grok 2026-08-22).  Added 2026-08-22 (AG); hardened 2026-08-22 (Grok) after a first-run loop closed/reopened ~1700 issues per cycle. | **Up** after harden restart |
| **pm2 `vision-worker`** | Always-on | CT scanned-PTR worker.  Moved off launchd 2026-08-16.  Grok CLI solo pass first (`--cwd grok-cwd`, medium effort, JSON schema, turns scaled 4+2*pages); on miss cascade Qwen3-VL 8B/30B (page images) then Gemini 3.7 Flash then grok-4.5.

| `com.PM2` | Login one-shot | `pm2 resurrect` at login (`pm2.jay.plist`, `LaunchOnlyOnce`).  Logs: `~/Library/Logs/com.PM2.*.log`. | Re-bootstrapped Fri, Aug 21 2026.  `LaunchOnlyOnce` exits after resurrect and can drop out of `launchctl print` — that is expected.

| **pm2 `shellular`** | Always-on | Phone → this Mac (Shellular).  Pinned install: `~/apps/shellular-runtime` (v0.0.52).  **Not** launchd — `com.jay.shellular` is **disabled**.  Grok Build spawn (`~/.shellular/agents.json`): `~/.grok/bin/grok agent --always-approve --leader stdio`.  `--always-approve` / `--leader` are `agent` flags — **never** after `stdio`. | **Up** |

Script: `~/Code/Congress.Trade/scout/run-residential-proxy.sh`. | **Up** — local `/health` 200 |
| **pm2 `scout`** | Retired | Retired 2026-08-28 (AG) in favor of server-directed scraping via Tailscale `residential-proxy`. Replaced by `residential-proxy`. | **Retired** |
| **pm2 `senate-relay`** | Always-on | Local Senate eFD relay (`127.0.0.1:8899`) for `scout.jays.services`. Live code: `~/apps/senate-relay-runtime` (not the `~/Code/Congress.Trade` checkout — `code-main-keeper` would wipe an overlay). POST `/fetch-ptr` and `/fetch-doc` require `Bearer $SENATE_RELAY_SECRET` (`SENATE_RELAY_REQUIRE=1`, live 2026-08-21 after CT #2152). `/health` stays public. | **Up** — local `/health` 200 |

| `com.jay.botfleet-server` | Always-on | BotFleet harness server on loopback `127.0.0.1:8799` and webhook `8800`.  Directory: `~/apps/botfleet-server`, a detached worktree of `~/Code/BotFleet` at `origin/main` (moved off the stale, dirty `~/apps/botfleet-grok` lane 2026-09-02, Claude; that lane had crash-looped the job 15,781 times).  Plist backup: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jay.botfleet-server.plist.bak-20260902`.  Refresh code with `~/apps/update-botfleet.sh`.

| `com.jay.botfleet-imessage-relay` | Retired / Forbidden | Retired 2026-09-02 (Antigravity).  Violated the strict owner account boundary: automated outbound messages must NEVER be sent from user `jay`.  Caused an infinite echo loop with `imessage-botfleet.py` on `agents`.  All outbound bot messages must ONLY be sent via `agents` (`agentchat@icloud.com`).  Never re-enable under `jay`. | **Retired / Forbidden** |
| `com.jay.uptimerobot-monitor-relay` | Always-on | Polls UptimeRobot monitors every 60s and forwards outage/down (8/9) and recovery/up (2) webhook events to BotFleet Monitor bot (`wh_pq10-Fgea1ksaXGO` on `127.0.0.1:8800`).  Script: `~/apps/uptimerobot-monitor-relay.py`.  Added 2026-09-02 (Antigravity). | **Up** |
| `com.jay.imessage-accountant-forward` | Always-on | Forwards accountant-relevant iMessages.  `KeepAlive=true`.  A **fleet** job that was missing from this list until 2026-09-01 (Claude). |
| `com.jay.imessage-grok` | Always-on (intended) | Grok inbox for iMessage group Grok - Socratic Trade.  Reads `chat.db`.  Plist now calls Xcode `Python.app` (not `/usr/bin/python3`). | launchd **disabled** (FDA).  Aqua orphan **Up** (pid 81696, `ppid=1`, this is the intended listener — do not kill as a leak).  launchd-spawned `Python.app` still gets `authorization denied` on `chat.db`.  Owner: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → allow that `Python.app` for background, then `launchctl enable gui/501/com.jay.imessage-grok` and bootstrap.  Do not load until then (KeepAlive would crash-loop every 10s). |
| `com.jay.shellular` | Disabled | Old launchd wrapper (`npx shellular start`).  Disabled 2026-08-12.  Do not re-enable while pm2 owns it. | **Disabled** |
| `com.jay.agy-acp` / `com.jay.xcode-health` / `com.congress.trade.vision-worker` / `com.cursor.slack-sync` | Retired launchd | Replaced by the pm2 jobs of the same name.  Labels **disabled**.  Plists left on disk. | **Disabled** |

## Scheduled (fires, then exits)

| Name | Cadence | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `com.jay.disk-janitor` | every 30 min | Regenerable-cache + CleanMyMac CLI deep sweep + idle-worktree cleanup when disk is tight (< 80G free; pressure at 65G).  Walks fleet Code repos including BotFleet/fleet-ops.  Kimi-named / nested `.claude/worktrees` / `/tmp` scratch reaped when clean.  `STALE_DAYS=2` under 80G free.  Steal a run-lock older than 2h. |
| `com.jay.merge-shepherd` | every 30 min | `gh pr update-branch` so bot merges still retrigger verify.  Same 2h stale-lock steal (wedged 2026-07-14..16). |
| `com.jay.mac-process-watch` | every 120 s | Always-on restarter + scheduled-timer keeper.  pm2 via `~/.pm2/pm2.pid` + `kill -0` (do not pgrep -f).  launchd always-on: bootstrap / kickstart.  Scheduled: bootstrap if not-loaded; **idle is OK**.  Never bootstrap `com.jay.ios-ship-now` or `com.PM2`.  Steals janitor/shepherd locks >2h.  Checks trigger script paths exist.  Backoff 4/hour.  `MAC_PROCESS_WATCH_RESTART=0` = log-only. |
| `com.jays.mac-server-watchdog` | every 120 s | Mac heartbeat → Usage Monitor + local self-heal. |
| `com.jays.antigravity-usage-collector` | every 4 h | Antigravity quota → Usage Monitor ingest (via Infisical). |
| `com.jays.codex-usage-collector` | every 15 min | Codex CLI session JSONL tokens → Usage Monitor ingest (estimated API-equivalent).  On-demand: `npm run codex:collect -- --dry-run`. |
| `com.jays.grok-usage-collector` | every 15 min | Grok Build `updates.jsonl` turn_completed tokens + costUsdTicks → Usage Monitor ingest (estimated API-equivalent).  On-demand: `npm run grok:collect -- --dry-run`. |
| `com.jays.copilot-usage-collector` | every 15 min | Copilot CLI `session-state/*/events.jsonl` shutdown modelMetrics tokens → Usage Monitor ingest (estimated API-equivalent).  On-demand: `npm run copilot:collect -- --dry-run`. |
| `com.jay.mac-cleanup` | every 4 h (14400s) | **2026-09-01 (Claude):** now takes a **re-entrant owner-token lock** (`~/.claude-disk-janitor/.housekeeper.lock`, 2h stale-steal) — it previously had none while two independent invokers reached it.  Callers already holding it export `HOUSEKEEPER_LOCK_OWNER=1` so the parent does not deadlock its own children.  `cleanmymac optimize ram` is **removed** (gated behind `RESOURCE_ALLOW_RAM_OPTIMIZE=1`): it purges resident pages into swapfiles on the same APFS container as user data, measured **+3.6-7.3G swap per run**.  Plist gained `EnvironmentVariables:PATH` — launchd's default PATH excludes `/opt/homebrew/bin`, so the `npm`/`pnpm`/`brew`/`cleanmymac` blocks had been silently no-opping under launchd.  Safe developer cache, CleanMyMac CLI (system junk, dev junk, AI cache, trash), Xcode iOS DeviceSupport/DerivedData, unavailable simulators only (`simctl delete unavailable`), agent session prune, and remote Hetzner Coolify docker prune.  **Wipes `~/.npm/_npx`.**  `--pressure` adds CleanMyMac purge + 3-day Grok session prune.  Does **not** reap git worktrees or wipe `~/.grok/worktrees` — that is `com.jay.disk-janitor`. |
| `com.jay.mac-resource-watch` | every 5 min (300s) | **2026-09-01 (Claude) — loop fix.  Cleanup previously had NO cooldown (only the webhook did), so with disk hovering under the 80G warn line it ran `mac-auto-cleanup.sh --pressure` every 5 min, back to back.  Measured: each run grew swap 3.6-7.3G and 2 of 3 runs ended with LESS free disk.**  Now: `CLEAN_COOLDOWN_SEC=3600` (`900` when critical), a single-flight lock, 3x backoff when a run frees nothing, and cache cleanup only on a **disk** hit (swap/load-only pressure no longer triggers it — deleting caches cannot reduce swap).  `--clean` no longer bypasses the cooldown (all four BF-Housekeeper surfaces pass it); `--force` is the only bypass.  The `swap_total_gb >= 8` disjunct is **removed** — macOS grows the swap store on demand, so once past 8G it was true forever and every tick reported a hit; the gate is now `swap_used_pct >= 80 AND swap_used_gb >= 8`.  Webhook now sends **both** `X-BotFleet-Event` and `X-Webhook-Event` (the launchd receiver on :8800 runs older code that only reads the latter) and parses the response body — a 202 is returned for accepted/ignored/captured/duplicate alike, and only a payload carrying `runId` actually started a bot.  Samples disk free, swap, and 1-minute load.  On warn/crit (disk ≤80G / drop ≥6G / swap ≥80% and ≥8G total / load ≥16) runs `mac-auto-cleanup.sh --pressure` and POSTs BotFleet Housekeeper webhook (`resource.disk` / `resource.ram` / `resource.cpu`).  Cooldown 45 min.  Secret `~/.secrets/botfleet-housekeeper-webhook.env` (never print).  Live `~/apps/mac-resource-watch.py`.  Tracked `scripts/mac-resource-watch.py` + `scripts/launchd/com.jay.mac-resource-watch.plist`. |
| `com.jay.fleet-gdrive-backup` | daily 06:00 local | Zip `~/Code` git repos to Google Drive `Website & App Source Backups - YYYY-MM-DD` **and** mirror fleet agent skills/rules into `My Drive/fleet-agent-config/` plus refresh `My Drive/fleet-skills/`.  List = `fleet-apps.json` plus extra Code checkouts (code-main-keeper skip list).  Live `~/apps/fleet-gdrive-backup/run.sh`.  Tracked `scripts/backup-fleet-to-gdrive.py` + `scripts/sync-fleet-agent-config-to-gdrive.py` + `scripts/launchd/com.jay.fleet-gdrive-backup.plist`.  GitHub 90-day artifacts: coordinator `.github/workflows/backup-repos.yml`.  **Scheduled, not always-on.** |
| `com.jay.grok-idle-unload` | hourly (3600s) | **Scheduled, not always-on.**  `session/close` on **live** Grok TUI chats idle >12h so their MCP tool processes exit.  Does **not** `/delete` transcripts.  `/resume` or `grok --resume ID` reloads tools.  Skips working / needs-input / pendingTool / `$GROK_SESSION_ID`.  Also SIGTERMs orphan MCP children whose session is no longer live and is missing or also idle >12h.  Override: `GROK_IDLE_UNLOAD_HOURS` in the plist.  Live `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/grok-idle-unload.py`.  Tracked `scripts/grok-acp-runtime/grok-idle-unload.py` + `scripts/launchd/com.jay.grok-idle-unload.plist`.

## On-login / one-shot launchd

| Name | Kind | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `com.jay.ios-ship-now` | One-shot at login | GUI-session TestFlight ship (needs login keychain).  KeepAlive false.  Last exit **1** from the 2026-08-13 login run: `rcs st=1 ct=1 um=0 ul=0`.  Socratic archive failed (`Tab` iOS 18 APIs / type-check).  Congress dirty worktree.  Not a stale lock (`archive.lockdir` absent).  Later TF than 1.0.14 exists (local seq ST 65 / CT 66).  Do not re-fire from this job. |
| `com.jay.provider-knob-sync` | Scheduled (30 min) | `~/apps/provider-knob-sync-start.sh` → `scripts/sync-provider-knobs.sh --apply`.  Slack token lives in `~/.secrets/provider-knob-sync.env` (not the LaunchAgent env).  **Not** always-on — `StartInterval=1800`, `RunAtLoad=false`.  Do not invent a KeepAlive job. |

Login items (Aqua, user apps — not agent-owned): Wallspace, GeminiAppLauncher, Devly, Kimi, Google Drive, Dockspace.

## On-demand helpers (able to be run; must not stay up)

These are the installed scripts agents actually invoke.  They are **not**
daemons.  If you add another one that other seats should use, list it here.
Worktree one-offs (`~/apps/congress-grok-*`, `trading-grok-*`) are **not**
listed — those die with the branch.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `~/apps/send-sms` / `~/apps/local-sms-gateway/send-sms.py` | Local Twilio SMS gateway & CLI for one-way SMS alerts to owner. Symlinked to `/usr/local/bin/send-sms`. Supports CLI (`send-sms "msg"`) and localhost HTTP server (`--serve --port 8787`). |
| `~/Code/Usage-Monitor/scripts/namecheap.py` | Namecheap XML API CLI for querying balances, listing active domains, checking domain availability, and inspecting DNS records. |
| `~/apps/hetzner-watcher/check-hetzner-availability.py` | On-demand & scheduled. Checks Hetzner Cloud API in Nuremberg (`nbg1`) for scarce server models (`cx53`, `cx43`, `ccx53`, `ccx63`) and sends immediate SMS alerts via `send-sms`. |
| `~/apps/apple-notes-coding.sh` | Create/update/pin Coding notes. |
| `~/apps/icloud-mail.py` / `~/apps/icloud-mail.sh` | On-demand. Fleet-wide iCloud Mail CLI & library for IMAP/SMTP message listing, search, reading, triage, and sending. MCP launcher: `~/apps/mcp-servers/icloud-mail-launch.sh`. Doc: `~/apps/ICLOUD-MAIL.md`. |
| `~/apps/agent-sync-poll.py` | One-pass #agent-sync read (session start). |
| `~/apps/agent-sync-websocket.py` | Local Slack post helper (needs slack_sdk). |
| `~/apps/agent-sync/consumer.mjs` | Slack Socket Mode consumer (session attach). |
| `~/apps/slack-sync.sh` | Bot-token Slack read/post without MCP. |
| `~/apps/mac-status.sh` | One-screen pm2 + launchd + down-watch.  **This is the command.**  Run it as the alias **`ms`** (`.zshrc:29`) — the alias is how people actually find it.  Annotates TUI-held `leader.sock` and the `ios-ship-now` login leftover. |
| `~/Code/ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/fleet-rag.py` | On-demand.  Thin CLI over `scripts/fleet_rag/` for the `fleet-agents` knowledge corpus.  `stats` / `search "..."` / `ingest file.jsonl` / `ingest-all`.  Talks to the **Hetzner** services `qdrant-st` (`100.69.77.26:6333`) and `tei-bge-m3` (`100.69.77.26:8081`) over Tailscale — nothing runs locally, so there is no daemon to keep up.  Loads creds from Infisical shared/prod by itself.  Ingest is idempotent by content hash.  Canonical: `docs/RAG-FLEET-INFRA.md`.  Do **not** point Socratic.Trade's embed provider at that endpoint — see the doc's parity section. |
| `~/apps/fleet-rag/recall` | On-demand.  Installed copy of `scripts/recall` (search / stats / contribute / eval / doctor / ingest).  Symlinked at `~/apps/mac-collab/recall` and `~/.local/bin/recall` (same PATH pattern as `board`).  MCP stdio server is `~/apps/fleet-rag/fleet-recall-mcp.py`.  Installer: `scripts/install-fleet-rag.sh`. |
| `~/.claude/hooks/fleet-recall-session-start.sh` + `~/.claude/hooks/fleet-recall-stop.py` | Always-on (Claude Code hooks, registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` SessionStart + Stop).  SessionStart adds one context line (corpus size; search before re-deriving, contribute at closeout).  Stop nudges once per substantial session (25+ tool uses, no `recall_contribute` yet) to commit a lesson or reply "no lesson"; honours `stop_hook_active`, marker under `~/apps/fleet-rag/state/hook-nudged/`.  `FLEET_RECALL_HOOKS=0` disables.  Installed by `install-fleet-rag.sh --hooks`; tracked `scripts/hooks/`.  Added 2026-09-02 (Claude). |
| `~/apps/fleet-rag/fleet-recall-mcp.py` | On-demand (stdio MCP `fleet-recall`, spawned by Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / Grok / Antigravity / Grok ACP per session).  Tools `recall_search` / `recall_contribute` / `recall_stats`.  No daemon.  Canonical: `docs/RAG-FLEET-INFRA.md`. |
| BotFleet routines `Fleet RAG nightly ingest` (02:30 daily) + `Fleet RAG weekly health + recall eval` (Sun 06:30) | Always-on (BotFleet bot Oracle, `~/.botfleet/routines.json`, loopback API `127.0.0.1:8799/api/routines`).  Nightly: `recall ingest --all --prune` + sentinel; the Hetzner `fleet-health-verify.sh` pages when the sentinel is >30 h old.  Weekly: `recall doctor --platforms --box`, eval, digest → Apple Note "[FLEET, Oracle] Weekly recall digest".  Added 2026-09-01, updated 2026-09-02 (Claude). |
| `~/Code/ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/install-fleet-rag.sh` | On-demand.  Copies `fleet_rag/` + `recall` + MCP server into `~/apps/fleet-rag/`, registers `fleet-recall` in Claude / Cursor / Gemini / Codex / Grok MCP configs (no tokens), optionally copies seat-mcp recall tools.  Does **not** restart `qdrant-st`.  `--with-seat-mcp` prints `pm2 restart seat-mcp` but does not run it. |
| `~/Code/ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/install-fleet-skills.py` | On-demand.  Installs fleet skills into `~/.gemini/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, and `~/.grok/skills`, specializing Slack tag / Notes name / branch prefix / worktree suffix per seat. |
| `~/apps/fleet-gdrive-backup/run.sh` | Also on-demand.  Same Drive backup as launchd `com.jay.fleet-gdrive-backup` (repo zips + agent-config mirror).  `--list` prints the repo set.  `--only Repo` zips one app.  Tracked `scripts/backup-fleet-to-gdrive.py` + `scripts/sync-fleet-agent-config-to-gdrive.py`. |
| `~/apps/cursor-mac-process-hook.sh` | On-demand.  Fast pm2 always-on check (8s cap, fail open, no secrets).  Cursor `sessionStart` user hook (`~/.cursor/hooks/mac-process-check.sh`) calls this and injects `additional_context` when jobs are down. |
| `~/apps/cursor-chat-surfaces/` | On-demand.  Grok Bot / Shellular Cursor → desktop Agents Window + iOS.  Grok Bot is already Cloud Agents (open Agents Window; Filter → Source → SDK if hidden).  Shellular id `cursor` is the cloud bridge (`session/list` = Cloud Agents, never execs `cursor-agent`).  id `cursor-local` is `cursor_acp_noauth_shim.py` wrapping `cursor-agent acp` (strips `authMethods` so iOS 0.0.43 does not show Authentication required).  Command: `~/apps/cursor-chat-surfaces/cursor-chat-surfaces status`.  Canonical: `docs/CURSOR-CHAT-SURFACES.md`.  Key: `CURSOR_SYNC_API_KEY` in `~/.secrets/global-api-keys`.  Do **not** add this to the 14 always-on pm2 jobs. |
| `~/apps/dsh-runtime/` | Pinned DeepSeek Harness (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`).  **Never `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh`.**  Web UI is always-on pm2 `dsh-web` on **:3080** (~12 MB RSS / 0% CPU idle — cheap enough to leave up).  Dock app: `~/Applications/DeepSeek Harness Web.app` is a WKWebView shell (running-dot, second click focuses the same window).  Rebuild: `~/apps/dsh-runtime/install-dock-app.sh`.  `dsh-acp.sh` is Shellular id `deepseek`. |
| `~/apps/cursor-chat-surfaces/cursor-machine-worker.sh` | On-demand.  `agent worker start --name jay-mac` so Cloud Agents can run tools on this Mac.  Only when `CURSOR_BRIDGE_ON_MAC=1`. |
| `~/apps/pm2-ecosystem.config.cjs` | pm2 definitions for the 14 always-on fleet jobs (incl. `mac-collab-sync`). |
| `~/apps/mac-process-watch.sh` | Scheduled down-watch + always-on restarter (also launchd).  Tracked copy: `ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/mac-process-watch.sh`. |
| `~/apps/agy-acp-runtime` | Pinned `@rebornix/stdio-to-ws` for `agy-acp`. |
| `~/apps/seat-mcp/start.sh` | On-demand / already-running.  seat-mcp on `127.0.0.1:8793`.  Token `~/.secrets/seat-mcp.env`.  Public hostname `agents.jays.services` (Access).  v1.1 tools: `grok_sessions_list` / `grok_session_peek` / `grok_session_prompt` for live TUI attach.  Do not start a second copy if 8793 is listening.  `ecosystem.snippet.cjs` exists; do not `pm2 start` / `pm2 save` from a one-off. |
| `~/apps/mcp-servers/seat-mcp-launch.sh` | On-demand.  stdio proxy into local seat-mcp.  Grok TUI `~/.grok/config.toml` + Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` point here.  Token never in those files. |
| `~/apps/agy-acp-runtime/agy-acp-turbo.sh` | Shellular Antigravity ACP wrapper (`--dangerously-skip-permissions --mode accept-edits --skip-naration`). Symlinked to `~/.local/bin/agy-acp-turbo`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime` | Pinned Grok ACP adapter.  localhost `127.0.0.1:12419` only.  Never `:2419`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/leader.sh` | pm2 `grok-leader` entry.  Shared backend on `~/.grok/leader.sock`.  Exits 75 when the socket is already bound.  Tracked copy: `ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/grok-leader.sh`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/leader-client.py` | `handshake` / `list` / `load` / `peek` / `prompt` / `close` over leader stdio (no extra packages).  Tracked `scripts/grok-acp-runtime/leader-client.py`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/grok-drive.py` | On-demand.  Any-seat CLI: `list` / `peek` / `tail` / `prompt` / `await` / `cancel` / `close` / `new`.  `list` merges `active_sessions.json` `live=true` plus `turnState` and `pendingTool`.  Prompt uses `session/resume`.  `close` is `session/close` (unload MCP, keep disk).  Refuses `$GROK_SESSION_ID` unless `--self`.  Tracked `scripts/grok-acp-runtime/grok-drive.py`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/grok-idle-unload.py` | On-demand / hourly launchd.  Close live chats idle >12h.  `--dry-run` lists only.  `GROK_IDLE_UNLOAD_HOURS` overrides.  Tracked `scripts/grok-acp-runtime/grok-idle-unload.py`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/session_disk.py` | On-demand.  Disk peek / turnState / `poll_after_inject`.  Tracked `scripts/grok-acp-runtime/session_disk.py`. |
| `~/apps/mcp-servers/seat-mcp-stdio-proxy.py` | On-demand.  stdio → `127.0.0.1:8793/mcp`.  Reads `SEAT_MCP_TOKEN` from `~/.secrets/seat-mcp.env`.  Never on argv.  Tracked `scripts/mcp-servers/seat-mcp-stdio-proxy.py`. |
| `scripts/install-grok-tui-drive.sh` | On-demand.  After an AFL merge, copy tracked `scripts/grok-acp-runtime`, `scripts/seat-mcp`, and `scripts/mcp-servers/seat-mcp-*` into `~/apps/`.  `--restart-seat-mcp` only if pm2 already owns the job.  Do not bind a second `:8793`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/start.sh` | pm2 `grok-acp` entry: `--no-leader serve --bind 127.0.0.1:12419`.  Sources `~/.secrets/grok-acp.env`. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/acp-client.py` | Conductor WS client for **new** sessions on `:12419`.  `--mcp-server NAME` from user `~/.grok/config.toml`.  Auto-approves `session/request_permission`, implements ACP `terminal/*`, one WS pump, NDJSON `event=session` as soon as `session/new` returns. |
| `~/apps/grok-acp-runtime/README.md` | Leader + Conductor + Shellular attach notes. |
| `~/apps/cursor-slack-ws-sync.py` | Cursor #agent-sync Socket Mode inbox (also launchd). |
| `~/apps/botfleet-imessage-relay.py` | BotFleet 12-bot iMessage bidirectional relay daemon (also launchd `com.jay.botfleet-imessage-relay`). |
| `~/apps/uptimerobot-monitor-relay.py` | UptimeRobot 60s poller & BotFleet Monitor bot webhook relayer (also launchd `com.jay.uptimerobot-monitor-relay`). |
| `~/apps/update-botfleet.sh` | On-demand.  Moves `~/apps/botfleet-server` to `origin/main` (refuses a checkout with local edits), packages and installs `/Applications/BotFleet.app` from it, signs with the stable local Developer ID / Development certificate so macOS Keychain secret storage survives rebuilds, restarts `com.jay.botfleet-server`, waits for `/api/health`, then relaunches the app.  Rewritten 2026-09-02 (Claude); previous version at `update-botfleet.sh.bak-20260902`. |  Launchers: terminal alias `ubf` (`~/.zshrc`) runs this script directly; the double-click wrapper `~/apps/Update BotFleet.command` was moved off the Desktop on Wed, Sep 3, 2026 and calls the same script.
| `~/apps/imessage-grok-listen.py` | Grok iMessage group listener.  launchd disabled until FDA; Aqua orphan is the live process. |
| `~/apps/slack-agent-listen.py` | Slack DM multi-seat inbox.  Also launchd `com.jay.slack-agent-inbox`. |
| `~/apps/slack-agent-listen-start.sh` | launchd entry: sources agent-sync.env, execs the inbox. |
| `~/apps/slack-grok-listen.py` | Wrapper that execs `slack-agent-listen.py` (old Grok-only name). |
| `~/apps/slack-agent-inbox.md` | How to DM any seat from Slack. |
| `~/apps/xcode-health/xcode-health-server.py` | xcode.jays.services health (also launchd). |
| `~/vision-worker/run-vision-worker.sh` | CT scanned-PTR vision worker (also launchd). |
| `~/vision-worker/worker.py` | Vision worker body.  **Hand-copied deploy** of `Congress.Trade/services/vision-worker/worker.py` — merging a PR does **not** ship it.  After any vision-worker PR merges: `cp` the repo file here, `python3 -m py_compile`, run `python3 -m unittest discover -s ~/vision-worker -p 'test_worker.py'`, then `pm2 restart vision-worker --update-env`.  Drifted 31 commits behind `main` on 2026-08-21 because this was undocumented. |
| `~/apps/ios-fleet/ios-debug.sh` | On-demand.  Xcode-console equivalent without opening Xcode: simulator `simctl launch --console` + `log stream`, or device `devicectl` launch / screenshot + `log collect`.  `--target device --install-debug` replaces TestFlight for that bundle.  `--logs-only` does not.  Tracked copy: `ai-fleet-coordinator/scripts/ios-debug.sh`.  Canonical: AGENT-SYNC § iOS agent build loop (2026-08-21). |
| `~/apps/ios-fleet/ship-testflight.sh` | Archive + upload one iOS app to TestFlight.  Consults `build-window.sh` and re-execs itself under `nice -n 10` when the answer is `background`.  Never blocked, only deprioritised.  `IOS_SHIP_RENICED` guards against a re-exec loop; `IOS_SHIP_PRIORITY=normal` forces full speed.  **On-demand.**  After a successful archive: `sentry-cli debug-files upload` + `sentry-cli build upload` (Size Analysis) using `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`; injects `SENTRY_DSN` into xcodebuild when set.  Sentry failures warn, they do not fail the ship.  GitHub-hosted ships use each repo's vendored `scripts/ios-fleet/` pin, not this path. |
| `~/apps/ios-fleet/build-window.sh` | On-demand.  Decides iOS ship PRIORITY on this shared Mac; prints `normal` or `background`, always exit 0.  **socratic**: prefers X:15-X:45 (strategy runs own X:00-X:15, X:45-X:00 is buffer), unrestricted 20:00-06:00 local.  **congress**: any time unless CT has a non-zero `ingestion_backlog` on its public health route.  Others unconstrained.  FAILS OPEN to `normal` on any error - a broken check must never degrade a ship.  Inherited by `ship-all.sh` and `ship-now-gui.sh` since both call `ship-testflight.sh`.  Tune with `IOS_SHIP_WINDOW_START_MIN` / `_END_MIN` / `IOS_SHIP_QUIET_START_HOUR` / `_END_HOUR`. |

## Vendor / login-item (not agent-owned)

Always-on or scheduled, but agents did not install them.  Do not kill or
"clean up" these.

| `com.fiplab.mc3loginhelper` | Always-on | Memory Clean login helper.  (Its launchd **GUI instance label** is `application.com.fiplab.memoryclean3`, which is why label-based audits report it as a false gap — match on bundle name too.) |
| `com.adobe.ccxprocess` | Always-on (vendor) | Adobe Creative Cloud Experience process.  Agents did not install it — do not kill or clean up.  Added to the list 2026-09-01 (Claude) after a label cross-reference found it undocumented. |

## Not in this list (on purpose)

- Interactive `grok` / `claude` / `codex` / `cursor` terminals
- Per-session MCP children (`npm exec` MCP servers).  Those die with the parent.
  Orphans with `ppid=1` are leaks — kill those, not KeepAlive jobs.
- Coolify / Hetzner app containers
- iOS Simulator
- Apple system LaunchAgents

## How to add a row

1. Prefer `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jay.<name>.plist` or a `~/apps/<tool>-runtime` + pm2 job.
2. Label, program path, KeepAlive / interval, log path, one-line purpose, Kind.
3. Never put secrets in the plist.  Inject via Infisical or `~/.secrets/` at runtime, value-blind.
4. Update **this file first**, then `--update` the Apple Note, then the coordinator repo mirror.
5. Do not duplicate the full table into every app's AGENTS.md — point here.

```bash
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/<Label>
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/<Label>
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/<Label>
pm2 status
bash ~/apps/mac-status.sh
```

### pm2 orphan-holds-port recovery (2026-08-21, CLAUDE)

**Symptom.** One or more pm2 apps sit `errored` with a large `restart_time`, their
error log repeats `Address already in use` / `EADDRINUSE` / Deno `AddrInUse (os error 48)`,
and `pm2 jlist` / `pm2 restart` time out.

**Cause.** When the pm2 God daemon dies without reaping its children (memory pressure,
jetsam, a crash), the children are reparented to launchd and keep their listening socket.
The pm2-managed replacement can then never bind, so pm2 restart-loops it forever.  Nothing
inside that loop can clear the orphan.

**Recovery** (script: `~/apps/mac-collab/`-independent, see the CLAUDE rollout note):

1. `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.jay.mac-process-watch` -- pause the watchdog so its
   own `pm2 resurrect` cannot race the repair.  **Re-arm it afterwards with `launchctl
   bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jay.mac-process-watch.plist`.**
2. Record God's pid (`~/.pm2/pm2.pid`) and `pgrep -P <god>` BEFORE signalling anything --
   once the parent dies the survivors reparent and you lose the list.
3. `pm2 kill`, then SIGTERM (SIGKILL after ~6s) every recorded child plus every listener on
   a fleet port.  **Fleet ports: 8765 agy-acp, 8791 xcode-health, 8792 mac-collab, 8793 seat-mcp,
   8899 senate-relay, 12419 grok-acp.**  Missing a port here is how senate-relay stayed
   broken through the first pass of this repair (238 restarts against an orphan deno on 8899).
4. `rm -f ~/.pm2/{rpc.sock,pub.sock,pm2.pid}` -- stale IPC is why a freshly started God
   still answers nothing.
5. `pm2 resurrect` (from `~/.pm2/dump.pm2`), then `pm2 jlist` to confirm 14/14 online.
6. `pm2 reset all` so the next crash-loop is visible against a zero baseline, then `pm2 save`.

**Do not** SIGKILL God first and sort it out afterwards -- that is precisely how the orphans
are created.
