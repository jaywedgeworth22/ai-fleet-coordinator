# Mac & Hetzner Disk Cleanup Skill (ALL AGENTS)

> **This install is for `RENOIR`.** Slack `[RENOIR]`.  Notes `Renoir`.  Branches `renoir/`.  Worktrees `~/apps/<app>-renoir`.  Do not inherit another seat's tag from a shared template.

> **Inactive seat.** Renoir is not yet active.  Do not install to `~/.renoir/skills`.  Do not take fleet work until the owner opens the seat.


Optimize local workstation storage and remote Coolify server disk usage by running the unified automated maintenance sweep.

## How to Run the Cleanup

### 1. Direct Command (All Platforms)
Any agent (Antigravity, Grok, Claude, Cursor, Codex) or operator can execute the unified cleanup script directly:

```bash
bash /Users/jay/apps/mac-auto-cleanup.sh
```

Or using the CLI shortcut (available in `zsh` and `bash`):
```bash
mac-auto-cleanup
```

### 2. What It Cleans (Safe & Idempotent)

1. **Merged Git Worktrees**:
   - Owned by `com.jay.disk-janitor` (clean + idle + no `--force`).  This script does not reap worktrees or wipe `~/.grok/worktrees`.
2. **Xcode Developer Caches**:
   - Cleans `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport` symbols.
   - Cleans `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` build caches.
   - Prunes unavailable simulators only (`xcrun simctl delete unavailable`).  Never `rm -rf` `CoreSimulator/Devices`.
3. **Package Manager Caches**:
   - `npm cache clean --force` and `~/.npm/_npx`
   - `pnpm store prune`
   - `yarn cache clean`
   - `brew cleanup -s`
4. **CleanMyMac CLI Cleanup & RAM Optimization**:
   - `cleanmymac clean --force` (automatically cleans system junk, dev junk, AI tool caches, and trash bins).
   - `cleanmymac optimize ram` (frees up inactive system memory and optimizes RAM).
5. **Spotlight PipelineStorage Journals**:
   - Truncates oversized Apple Intelligence / CoreSpotlight `PipelineStorage` journals.
6. **Agent Session Transcripts**:
   - Prunes Grok session transcripts older than 7 days (`~/.grok/sessions`).
   - Prunes old Codex archived sessions (`~/.codex/archived_sessions`).
   - Prunes old Antigravity brain conversation folders older than 7 days (`~/.gemini/antigravity/brain`).
7. **Remote Hetzner Coolify Server (`167.233.254.55`)**:
   - Automatically triggers remote Docker cleanup (`docker builder prune -af --filter "until=72h"` and `docker system prune -af --volumes`).

Pass `--pressure` (or `MAC_CLEANUP_PRESSURE=1`) for the tighter path: CleanMyMac purge, 3-day Grok session prune, pm2 log cap.  Resource-watch uses that flag.

## Scheduled Automation
- **Mac LaunchAgent**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jay.mac-cleanup.plist` runs automatically every 4 hours (`StartInterval: 14400`).
- **Resource watch**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jay.mac-resource-watch.plist` every 5 minutes.  Samples disk/RAM/CPU, runs this script on a hit, and POSTs BotFleet Housekeeper.  See the `housekeeper` skill.
- **Hetzner Cron**: `/etc/cron.d/coolify-maintenance` runs automatically every 4 hours.

## Quick Status Check
To view live disk space and system process health:
```bash
ms
# or
bash ~/apps/mac-status.sh
```
