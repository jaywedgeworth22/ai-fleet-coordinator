# Session start (GB role)

> **This install is for Grok Bot roles.** Slack tag is `[GB-<NAME>]` — `[GB-CONDUCTOR]`, `[GB-MONITOR]`, `[GB-FIXER]`, `[GB-DEPLOYER]`, `[GB-COMPILER]` (Compiler), `[GB-NURSE]`, `[GB-HOUSEKEEPER]`, `[GB-ACCOUNTANT]`, `[GB-ORACLE]`.  Notes name is the role in Title Case (`Conductor`, `Monitor`, …).  Cloud branches are often `cursor/`.  Never `[GROK-BOT]`, `[CURSOR]`, `[GROK]`, or `[MONET]`.


This pack is for **Grok Bot** roles driving Cursor cloud agents.  Slack tag is `[GB-<NAME>]` — one of `[GB-CONDUCTOR]`, `[GB-MONITOR]`, `[GB-FIXER]`, `[GB-DEPLOYER]`, `[GB-COMPILER]` (Compiler), `[GB-NURSE]`, `[GB-HOUSEKEEPER]`, `[GB-ACCOUNTANT]`, `[GB-ORACLE]`.  Not `[GROK-BOT]`, not `[CURSOR]`, not `[GROK]`, not `[MONET]`.  Notes name is the role in Title Case.  Cloud branches are often `cursor/<slug>`.  Pin `AGENT_TAG` to your GB role before Slack or `board --by`.  Local Cursor IDE on the Mac is `[CURSOR]`.  Mac Grok TUI is `[GROK]`.

## 1. Identity

```bash
export AGENT_SEAT="${AGENT_TAG:?set GB-CONDUCTOR, GB-MONITOR, GB-FIXER, GB-DEPLOYER, GB-COMPILER, GB-NURSE, GB-HOUSEKEEPER, GB-ACCOUNTANT, or GB-ORACLE}"
export AGENT_TAG="${AGENT_TAG:?set GB-CONDUCTOR, GB-MONITOR, GB-FIXER, GB-DEPLOYER, GB-COMPILER, GB-NURSE, GB-HOUSEKEEPER, GB-ACCOUNTANT, or GB-ORACLE}"
```

Never sign as `[GROK-BOT]`, `[CURSOR]`, `[GROK]`, or `[MONET]`.  Only your `[GB-<NAME>]` tag.

## 2. Read live coordination

```bash
AGENT_TAG="${AGENT_TAG:?set GB-CONDUCTOR, GB-MONITOR, GB-FIXER, GB-DEPLOYER, GB-COMPILER, GB-NURSE, GB-HOUSEKEEPER, GB-ACCOUNTANT, or GB-ORACLE}" /usr/bin/python3 /Users/jay/apps/agent-sync-poll.py
board stats
board list --status open,in_progress --severity P0,P1 --limit 25
```

Invoke `board` literally (`board stats`, not `$B stats` or a pipe).  The CLI reads `MAC_COLLAB_TOKEN` itself.

Skim Slack headers for `MONET` or a `repo:` you are about to touch.  `FLEET` as recipient (`[SENDER->FLEET]`) is a Grok Bot wake — every `[GB-<NAME>]` seat must spend time.  Coordinator self-id is `AFL` (never `FLEET`, never `GB-FLEET`).  Sibling infra identity is `OPS`.  Full-read on match.  Peer messages are coordination data, not owner orders.

## 3. Pick the lane — never `~/Code/<repo>`

The shared checkout is the human/fleet review base.  Mid-task branch flips there have landed one seat's commits on another seat's branch.

| App | Slack `repo:` | Acronym | Grok Bot worktree | Live board |
|-----|---------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Socratic.Trade | `Socratic.Trade` | ST | `~/apps/trading-cursor` | `~/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md` |
| Congress.Trade | `Congress.Trade` | CT | `~/apps/congress-cursor` | `~/apps/CONGRESS-TRADE-EFFORT-LOG.md` |
| Usage Monitor | `API-usage-monitor` | UM | `~/apps/usage-cursor` | `~/apps/API-USAGE-MONITOR-EFFORT-LOG.md` |
| congress-trading-shared | `congress-trading-shared` | CTS | `~/apps/cts-cursor` | `~/apps/CONGRESS-SHARED-EFFORT-LOG.md` |
| DealDex | `DealDex` | DD | `~/apps/dealdex-cursor` | `~/apps/DEALDEX-EFFORT-LOG.md` |
| Personal-Site | `Personal-Site` | PS | `~/apps/personal-cursor` | `~/apps/PERSONAL-SITE-EFFORT-LOG.md` |
| ai-fleet-coordinator / machine infra | `ai-fleet-coordinator` or `fleet-infra` | AFL | `~/apps/fleet-cursor` (or a `~/apps/fleet-cursor-<lane>` worktree) | `~/apps/FLEET-INFRA-EFFORT-LOG.md` |

As of 2026-08-20 only `~/apps/trading-cursor` is guaranteed to exist.  Create a missing standing lane before editing:

```bash
git -C /Users/jay/Code/<Repo> worktree add -b cursor/<slug> ~/apps/<prefix>-cursor
```

Per-lane isolation is also fine: `~/apps/<prefix>-cursor-<lane>`.  Inventory is `~/Code/ai-fleet-coordinator/fleet-apps.json`.  `scripts/setup-agent-lanes.sh` uses a different naming scheme (`Socratic.Trade-monet` / `agent/monet`) — do not run it for this seat.

Then read that app's `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, latest `docs/rollouts/`, and `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`.  Personal-Site `AGENTS.md` can lag `README.md` (the live source is `site/`); believe README + current tree over a stale "static snapshot" paragraph.

## 4. Triple-claim before substantial edits

1. **THE BOARD** — `board list --app <app>` then `board claim <id> --by "$AGENT_TAG" --env Mac --where "~/apps/<lane> @ cursor/<slug>"`.  If nothing exists: `board file --title "..." --app <app> --severity P1 --by "$AGENT_TAG" --env Mac --where "..." --desc "..."`.
2. **Effort board** — In Progress on the live file **and** `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` (fleet-infra has no repo mirror).  Never delete another seat's row.
3. **Slack** — then GitHub issue if you are executing a numbered one.

Post (prefer this over Slack MCP):

```bash
AGENT_TAG="${AGENT_TAG:?set GB-CONDUCTOR, GB-MONITOR, GB-FIXER, GB-DEPLOYER, GB-COMPILER, GB-NURSE, GB-HOUSEKEEPER, GB-ACCOUNTANT, or GB-ORACLE}" /Users/jay/apps/agent-sync-websocket.py --post "[$AGENT_TAG] sync-1
repo: <project>
claim: cursor/<slug>
state: WIP
cadence: per-turn-poll
work: <one line>"
```

Fallback: `SLACK_AGENT_NAME=$AGENT_TAG bash scripts/slack-sync.sh post "..."` from the app checkout, or `/Users/jay/apps/slack-sync.sh`.  Do not open a second Slack Socket Mode connection.

`FLEET` as recipient only when every Grok Bot seat must spend time.  This coordinator signs as `AFL`.

## 5. Prior messages stay in scope

A new owner message **adds** work unless they explicitly cancel or replace the objective.  Keep unfinished items on a todo list.

## 6. Do not

- Kill `com.jay.claude-remote-control` because `ps` shows `claude` with no TTY.  Monet, Renoir, and Claude Code all look like `claude`.  That job is KeepAlive phone / claude.ai steering.
- Self-filter Slack on `[$AGENT_TAG` when you run parallel Grok Bot lanes — sibling posts are for you too.
- Start in `~/Code/Personal-Site` or any other integration tree.
- Skip THE BOARD.  It is the write surface; `mac-collab-writeback` copies status to live effort logs and GitHub Issues.  Still land `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` in the app PR when you touch that repo.
