# Fleet RAG infrastructure — self-hosted embeddings + the shared agent memory

Owner-directed 2026-08-31 (stand-up, board `7dbd6228`) and 2026-09-01 (make it fully operational
and reachable from every platform, boards `17f4547c` `9c75471c` `c799b564` `0f9a13b1`), CLAUDE
seat.  This is the knowledge layer described as "Plan B" in
`docs/reviews/2026-08-27-fleet-ops-review.md`: one place every agent, on every platform, can look
up lessons learned, owner preferences, how the infrastructure is wired, and what a past board row
resolved — and contribute to — instead of bulk-loading every protocol document into every session.

Both services run on the shared Hetzner box (`host.jays.services`, 16 vCPU / 30 GiB) as Coolify
services, bound to the Tailscale mesh only.  Neither is reachable from the public interface.

## What exists

| Service | Coolify UUID | Endpoint (mesh only) | Caps | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qdrant-st` | `ookh0qmlgrbxlwbbe6lolx6g` | `http://100.69.77.26:6333` | 4 CPU / 12 GiB | `api-key` header (write key, or the read-only key for reads) |
| `tei-bge-m3` | `cday9viyj6mwlfr8egnoknoa` | `http://100.69.77.26:8081` | 6 CPU / 10 GiB | `Authorization: Bearer` |
| `tei-reranker` | `xltcpxtquhyrjbc5em6dio8j` | `http://100.69.77.26:8082` | 4 CPU / 8 GiB | `Authorization: Bearer` (`TEI_RERANK_API_KEY`) |
| `recall-api` | see the rollout doc | `https://recall.jays.services` (public, Cloudflare Access + bearer `RECALL_API_TOKEN`) | 1 CPU / 1 GiB | bearer on every route but `/health` |

`tei-bge-m3` is Hugging Face `text-embeddings-inference:cpu-1.8` serving `BAAI/bge-m3`
(1024-dim, CLS pooling, L2-normalized) on CPU via the ONNX backend.  `tei-reranker` is the
same image serving the cross-encoder `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` (`/rerank`, about
0.5 s for 30 candidates; `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` has no ONNX export and took 54 s for 20 pairs
on CPU, so it was swapped out on 2026-09-02).  `recall-api` is the Mac-independent recall
service described under *From any other device*.  Despite the name, `qdrant-st` hosts two
collections and is no longer ST-only.

### Collections

| Collection | Points | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `socratic-trade` | ~801k | ST RAG, copied from Pinecone.  Embedded by **OpenRouter** `baai/bge-m3`.  **Serving ST production reads since 2026-08-31** (board `9e19673a`, stage 1 read-path cutover). |
| `fleet-agents` | grows nightly | The shared agent memory.  Embedded by the **self-hosted** endpoint. |

`fleet-agents` is 1024-dim cosine, vectors in RAM, with payload indexes on `source`, `app`,
`category`, `seat`, `doc_id`, `content_hash`, `created_at`, and a full-text index on `text` so
keyword and vector search are fused (see *Search*).

### Payload schema (v2)

Every point carries:

```jsonc
{
  "text":         "[Title › Section]\nthe chunk",
  "source":       "board | effort-log | apple-note | doc | skill | memory | chat-log | agent-contribution | meta",
  "app":          "fleet | socratic-trade | congress-trade | usage-monitor | dealdex | botfleet | ...",
  "category":     "lesson | preference | infrastructure | decision | runbook | finding | note | doc",
  "seat":         "CLAUDE | MONET | GROK | CODEX | AG | CURSOR | OWNER | FLEET",
  "doc_id":       "board/<uuid> | note/<id> | doc/<repo>/<path> | effort-log/<APP> | memory/<seat>/<file> | skill/<name> | chat/<platform>/<id>[#partN] | contrib/<SEAT>/<date>/<hash8>",
  "chunk_index":  0, "chunk_count": 3,
  "heading":      "Title › Section", "title": "...", "url": "https://...", "path": "/Users/jay/...",
  "created_at":   1788213600000, "updated_at": 1788213600000,
  "content_hash": "sha256 of text", "embed_model": "BAAI/bge-m3-selfhosted",
  "ingest_run":   "20260901T203000Z", "scrubbed": ["github-token"]
}
```

Point ids are `uuid5` over the content hash, so identical text anywhere collapses to one point
and re-ingesting unchanged content is a no-op.  One extra point, `doc_id = meta/ingest-status`
(`source = meta`), is the ingest sentinel described under *Health rows*; search excludes it.

## Sources (what gets ingested)

| Source | Where it comes from | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `board` | `~/apps/mac-collab/findings.db` (title, body, resolution, status, severity, comments) | category `lesson` when resolved, else `finding`; url is the board |
| `apple-note` | every note in the iCloud folder **Coding**, exported by AppleScript without stealing focus, cached by modification date | app and seat parsed from the `[APP, Agent]` title convention |
| `doc` | markdown in fleet app repos under `~/Code` (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/**/*.md`), plus the broader walk of ai-fleet-coordinator and fleet-ops, top-level `~/apps/*.md` except effort logs, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.grok/docs/**/*.md`, and `~/.grok/skills/**/SKILL.md` | GitHub blob URL when the file is in a repo.  Skip `node_modules`, `.git`, backups, dist, build, vendor, and `reviews/raw`.  Deduped by resolved path. |
| `effort-log` | `~/apps/*-EFFORT-LOG.md` and the protocol | one doc per file, app from the filename |
| `skill` | `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `~/.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` | deduped by content |
| `memory` | `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/*.md`, `~/.codex/memories/*.md` | the per-seat silos, so their lessons are shared |
| `chat-log` | infrequent policy scan of agent transcripts (not in `ingest --all`) | **Owner 2026-09-02:** only user turns that look like an owner ruling or infra/policy shift.  Not a lesson dump.  Agents contribute lessons via `recall_contribute`; chat review is sparingly for policy/infra drift.  Explicit `recall ingest --source chat-log`. |
| `agent-contribution` | `recall contribute` / `recall_contribute` | **Highest-yield write path.**  Scrubbed, gitleaks-gated, 40–4,000 chars.  Search first, then contribute the lesson at the moment it was learned. |

Mirror rules keep one copy of each document: the live `~/apps/*.md` copy wins over its
repo mirror (AGENT-SYNC, MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES, FLEET-UI-COPY, TEMPLATE-AGENTS), the by-seat and
repo copies of skills are skipped in favour of the `skill` source, effort-log mirrors are skipped
in favour of the live boards, and checkouts reachable under two spellings are walked once.
`recall ingest --prune` deletes the chunks of documents a source no longer yields.

Every chunk goes through the secret scrub (`scripts/fleet_rag/scrub.py`: well-known token shapes,
assignment patterns, basic-auth URLs) and then a gitleaks gate over the staged rows; anything
gitleaks still flags is dropped and counted in the run report.  Documents are chunked with a
markdown-aware chunker (~1,600 chars, 200 overlap, heading trail prepended) so a fragment still
carries its section context.

## Search

Hybrid with grouping, a lesson boost, and a reranker (all defaults; every one can be turned off):

1. The query is embedded and Qdrant's Query API fuses three prefetches with reciprocal rank
   fusion — plain dense, dense restricted to points whose full-text index matches any of the
   query's keyword terms, and dense restricted to agent contributions in the lesson categories
   (`prefer_lessons`, score threshold 0.6 so an unrelated lesson never squats in the top-5).
2. Candidates are grouped in-process by `doc_id` so one document yields one hit (`per_doc` 1..3
   widens it); the window grows adaptively when one document dominates.  Each hit carries
   `group_hits`, how many chunks of that document matched.
3. When `TEI_RERANK_URL` / `TEI_RERANK_API_KEY` are configured, the top `max(4*limit, 20)`
   documents are reranked by the cross-encoder (`mode` becomes `hybrid+rerank`, hits carry
   `rerank_score` and `fused_score`); any error or an 8 s budget overrun falls back silently to
   the fused order.  Reranking costs about two seconds per query.

Filters on `category` / `app` / `source` / `seat` and a `since_days` window are exact-match
payload filters; the ingest sentinel (`source=meta`) is always excluded.  A 75-question golden
set (`scripts/fleet_rag/golden.jsonl`: board rows, Apple Notes, contributions, owner rulings,
docs) and `recall eval --k 5 [--compare]` report Recall@1 / Recall@5 / MRR per source.
Measured 2026-09-02 on 36.9k points: fused only 0.71 / 0.84 / 0.77; with lessons + rerank
**0.76 / 0.92 / 0.83**.

## Using it

**Write path (owner 2026-09-02).**  `recall_contribute` is the highest-yield source — the seat
that just burned tokens on a trap is the only one that knows, and that is often invisible in
the chat log.  Search first, then contribute one paragraph.  Chat transcripts are *not* bulk
ingested as lessons; `ingest --all` skips `chat-log`.  An explicit `--source chat-log` pass is
a rare infra/policy scan of owner rulings only.

### From a Mac seat (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Grok, Antigravity, Monet)

The `fleet-recall` MCP server is registered in every CLI's global MCP config by
`scripts/install-fleet-rag.sh` (stdio, `python3 ~/apps/fleet-rag/fleet-recall-mcp.py`, no
tokens in any config file).  Tools:

- `recall_search(query, limit=5, category?, app?, source?, seat?, since_days?)`
- `recall_contribute(text, category, app="fleet", seat, title?, url?)`
- `recall_stats()`

The CLI is `recall`, on PATH through `~/.local/bin/recall` (and `~/apps/mac-collab/recall`) like `board`:

```bash
recall "pm2 orphan holds port"                       # ranked hits with source, date, board id / url
recall "rotate the Coolify token" --app fleet --limit 3 --since-days 60
recall contribute "TEI warmup memory scales with --max-batch-tokens; 4096 under 10 GiB is stable." --category lesson --app fleet
recall stats            # points, by source / app, embedder health
recall doctor           # credentials found (names only), key mode, service health
recall eval --k 5 [--compare]   # golden-set retrieval quality, with/without lessons and rerank
recall digest --days 7          # this week's contributions grouped by app (the weekly owner note)
recall doctor --platforms --box # parity table: every CLI config, skills, hooks, seat-mcp, routines, box rows
recall ingest --all --prune     # what the nightly routine runs (idempotent, resumable)
```

`recall contribute` refuses a near-duplicate (cosine >= 0.92 against existing contributions)
unless `--force`; the MCP tool returns `status: duplicate` with the existing lesson instead.
`--per-doc`, `--no-rerank`, and `--no-lessons` expose the search knobs; the MCP tool takes
`per_doc`, `rerank`, and `prefer_lessons`.

**Claude Code hooks** (installed by `install-fleet-rag.sh --hooks`, tracked under
`scripts/hooks/`): a SessionStart hook adds one line of context ("corpus N points; search before
re-deriving, contribute at closeout"), and a Stop hook nudges once per substantial session
(25+ tool uses, no contribution yet) to call `recall_contribute` or reply "no lesson".
`FLEET_RECALL_HOOKS=0` disables both; the Stop hook honours `stop_hook_active` so it can never
loop.

`scripts/fleet-rag.py` remains as the thin compatibility CLI (`stats` / `search` / `ingest`).

### From BotFleet bots

BotFleet's Claude driver imports `~/.claude.json` `mcpServers`, and the Codex and Grok drivers
read their CLIs' global configs, so Mac-side bots get the three tools once the installer has
run.  Oracle owns the ongoing work (see *Routines*).

iOS / a phone / a bot that is not on this Mac should use the public hop below, not stdio
Python.  Do not paste Infisical keys into a BotFleet room.

### From any other device (cloud seats, phone, Claude Code Cloud, Cursor cloud)

Two public hops, both Cloudflare Access + bearer, both serving the same three tools and the
same REST twins.  Health is public; everything else needs `Authorization: Bearer` plus the
Access service-token headers when you are not already on the Mac.

| Hop | Runs on | Bearer | Use it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`https://recall.jays.services`** — `scripts/fleet-recall-service` | Hetzner box (Coolify), next to Qdrant + TEI | `RECALL_API_TOKEN` (Infisical shared/prod) | default for recall; **works while the Mac is asleep** |
| `https://agents.jays.services` — `seat-mcp` | the Mac, over the named tunnel | `SEAT_MCP_TOKEN` | you also need the seat / Grok TUI tools; falls over when the Mac sleeps |

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Mac CLI (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Grok, AG, Monet) | stdio MCP `fleet-recall` (installer) or `recall` CLI |
| BotFleet on this Mac | inherits that stdio MCP from the engine config |
| Cursor cloud / Claude Code Cloud / Codex cloud / Grok Bot | remote MCP `https://recall.jays.services/mcp` (entry `fleet-recall` in `scripts/seat-mcp/mcp.example.json`); `https://agents.jays.services/mcp` when you need seat tools too |
| Anything that can HTTP | REST: `GET https://recall.jays.services/recall/stats`, `POST .../recall/search`, `POST .../recall/contribute` (same paths on agents.jays.services) |
| iOS BotFleet | same REST or remote MCP; the companion talks to the Mac harness when the Mac is the computer, otherwise `recall.jays.services` |

MCP tools on `/mcp`: `recall_search`, `recall_stats`, `recall_contribute` (`seat` is required
for contributions on both hops; a remote caller has no `AGENT_SEAT`).  REST bodies are the same
JSON as the MCP arguments.  The Hetzner service is a stdlib-only Python process
(`scripts/fleet-recall-service/server.py`) that imports `fleet_rag.recall_api` unchanged and
reads its configuration from the environment only (`QDRANT_*`, `TEI_*`, `RECALL_API_TOKEN`);
it reaches Qdrant and TEI over the host's Tailscale address (`100.69.77.26`, verified reachable
from a container on the `coolify` network 2026-09-02).  Deploy steps, the Coolify / DNS /
Access checklist, and client snippets for Claude Code Cloud, Cursor, and Codex are in
`scripts/fleet-recall-service/README.md`.

```bash
# REST, from any network that can reach recall.jays.services
curl -sS https://recall.jays.services/health          # public: {ok, version, collection, points, backend_ok}

curl -sS https://recall.jays.services/recall/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RECALL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: $CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID" \
  -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: $CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET"

curl -sS https://recall.jays.services/recall/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RECALL_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: $CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID" \
  -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: $CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"handoff file grep trap","limit":3}'
```

## Credentials

Canonical in **Infisical shared / prod** (project `18f563a3-9c88-454c-96eb-28fc9678f3ba`):
`TEI_URL`, `TEI_API_KEY`, `TEI_EMBED_MODEL`, `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`,
`QDRANT_READONLY_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_FLEET_COLLECTION`.  Coolify holds synced copies; Infisical is
the source of truth per the standing rule.

- **Read/write split.**  `QDRANT_READONLY_API_KEY` is loaded by `qdrant-st` as
  `QDRANT__SERVICE__READ_ONLY_API_KEY` and is what search / stats / eval use.  Only ingest and
  `contribute` use the write key.  Until the service has restarted with the new key, the client
  falls back to the write key on a 401/403 so reads never break.
- Every client loads credentials from the environment first, then from Infisical via the machine
  identity in `~/.secrets/global-api-keys`.  Values are never printed.

ST keeps its own `QDRANT_URL` / `QDRANT_API_KEY` in the ST project for the app runtime.  Rotating
the Qdrant write key means updating both places.

## Routines (BotFleet bot Oracle, owner direction 2026-09-01)

| Routine | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Fleet RAG nightly ingest | daily 02:30 local | `recall ingest --all --prune`, reads `~/apps/fleet-rag/state/last-run.json`, retries once, files a P1 on the board on repeated failure |
| Fleet RAG weekly health + recall eval | Sundays 06:30 local | `recall doctor --platforms --box` / `stats` / `eval` / `digest --days 7`, checks `recall.jays.services/health` and yesterday's snapshot, writes the owner note "[FLEET, Oracle] Weekly recall digest", files a P1 on regressions |

Routines live in `~/.botfleet/routines.json` and are managed through BotFleet's loopback API
(`POST http://127.0.0.1:8799/api/routines`).  Create payload: `name`, `prompt`, `botId`
(Oracle `79a3a7f8-e35f-4604-9e41-54e4af28c04a`), `runOn: maus`, `schedule`, `durationMinutes`.

## Backup

`/etc/cron.d/fleet-qdrant` on the box runs `/usr/local/sbin/fleet-qdrant-snapshot.sh` daily at
03:20 UTC (tracked here under `scripts/hetzner/`).  It asks Qdrant for a consistent snapshot of
each collection, moves the file off the storage volume to `/data/backups/qdrant/<collection>/`,
checksums it, copies it to Backblaze B2 (`jays-socratic-trade-eu/qdrant/socratic-trade`,
`jays-fleet-shared-eu/qdrant/fleet-agents`), keeps two locally and fourteen days remotely.  The
API key is read from the running container's environment at run time and never written to disk.
A full `socratic-trade` snapshot is ~6.4 GB and takes about a minute to create.

## Health rows

`/usr/local/sbin/fleet-health-verify.sh` (every 15 minutes, pages through the existing
rate-limited Pushover path on FAIL) now calls `fleet-qdrant-health.sh`, which fails when:

- the latest local snapshot of either collection is older than 36 hours, or
- the **ingest sentinel** (`doc_id = meta/ingest-status`, written by every ingest run with
  `updated_at` and `ok`) is older than 30 hours or its last run failed.

The sentinel is the dead-man switch for the Oracle routine: if BotFleet stops running it, the
box pages.  No credential leaves the box for this check.

## Measured behavior

Steady state on 6 vCPU, verified 2026-08-31:

- Single query embed: **120–300 ms**.
- Batched short texts: **~24 texts/sec** (the ONNX backend caps a batch at 8 requests).
- First boot downloads ~2.3 GB of ONNX weights and takes **~9 minutes** to become healthy.
  The weights persist in the `/var/lib/tei-data` bind mount, so redeploys start in ~30 s.
- Resident usage once warm: ~5.7 GiB of its 10 GiB cap, including page cache for the model.

Bulk re-embedding is the one workload to keep off this box: at ~24 texts/sec, re-embedding
the ~800k-vector ST corpus would run for roughly half a day while competing with the
money-path apps for cores.  The nightly fleet ingest only embeds changed chunks.

## Important: the self-hosted endpoint is NOT a drop-in for the ST corpus

Measured before deployment, comparing self-hosted vectors against stored `socratic-trade`
vectors for the identical payload text:

- cosine similarity mean **0.869**, min **0.685** (mismatched-pair control: 0.478)
- self-retrieval with a self-hosted query vector: **Recall@1 64%**, Recall@5 84%
- the same test using the stored vector itself: **Recall@1 88%** (the ceiling is below 100%
  because the corpus contains near-duplicate boilerplate chunks)

So self-hosted `bge-m3` produces vectors in a *related but different* space from whatever
OpenRouter actually serves under `baai/bge-m3`.  Pointing ST queries at this endpoint would
cost roughly a quarter of Recall@1 against the existing corpus.  Tracked as board `b99cba29`.

Consequences:

1. **`fleet-agents` is unaffected** — that corpus is embedded and queried entirely by this
   endpoint, so it is internally consistent and carries no migration risk.
2. **Do not swap ST's embedding provider to this endpoint** without re-embedding the full
   corpus and passing the Recall@8 gate.  ST's `embedSpaceFilterForModel` would also need
   the new model id added to the bge lineage, or every existing vector becomes invisible.
3. The root cause was not isolated.  Both candidates remain open: the ONNX export in the
   `BAAI/bge-m3` repo may differ from the reference weights, or the text stored in the
   payload may not be byte-identical to what was originally sent to the embedder.

## Operational notes

- **Warmup is the memory peak, and it scales with `--max-batch-tokens`.**  At 8192 tokens
  the container was OOM-killed at warmup under an 8 GiB limit, exiting cleanly enough
  (code 137, `OOMKilled=true`) that it looked like a crash loop.  4096 tokens under a
  10 GiB limit is stable.  Raising `--max-batch-tokens` again means raising the cap too.
- Inputs longer than 4096 tokens are truncated rather than split by TEI; the chunker keeps
  every chunk far below that.
- `/health` is intentionally unauthenticated so Coolify and uptime probes can reach it.
  `/embed` and `/v1/embeddings` require the bearer token.
- Coolify's `${SERVICE_PASSWORD_*}` magic interpolates inside `environment:` but **not**
  inside `command:` — a key passed as a command flag silently becomes an empty string, which
  disables auth.  Pass it as `API_KEY=${SERVICE_PASSWORD_TEIKEY}` in `environment:` instead.
- Qdrant restarts cold: the first deep ST queries after a restart can hit the 15 s timeout
  (bounded, `lookup_failed`); `QDRANT_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=60000` is set on ST for that reason.
  Restart `qdrant-st` outside market hours only.
