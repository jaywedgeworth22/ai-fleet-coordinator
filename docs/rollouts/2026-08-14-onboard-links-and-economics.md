# Onboarding links + subagent / model economics

## Context

Owner asked whether (1) agents must use sub-agents whenever they help and pick the most economical effective model per task (even if lower or higher than their session), and (2) onboarding docs are linked from the places agents start.  Economics was already in AGENT-SYNC but weaker.  Onboarding lived in README / QUICKSTART / DealDex only.

## What changed

- AGENT-SYNC § Delegation: spawn whenever it helps; right-size per task, not per session.
- Start-here tables (local path + GitHub URL) in TEMPLATE-AGENTS, both ONBOARDING docs, README, EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL, ST/CT/UM/DD AGENTS.md.
- Live `~/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md`, `EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md`, `AGENT-COORDINATION-QUICKSTART.md`, and Grok/Claude/Codex/Gemini global instruction files.
