# Owner-facing times are Central Time (2026-08-22)

Owner: agents kept saying `00:00 UTC`.  Convert.  Binding for every seat,
every platform, including chat.

Two spaces between sentences in this file.

## Conversion that started this

- `00:00 UTC` during CDT (March–November) is **7:00 PM CT the previous
  calendar day**.
- `00:00 UTC` during CST is **6:00 PM CT the previous calendar day**.
- Example: `2026-08-23T00:00:00Z` is Sat, Aug 22, 2026 at 7:00 PM CT.

## Policy

When you tell the owner a time, write America/Chicago labeled `CT` / `CDT` /
`CST`.  Never UTC-only in owner-facing prose.  UTC may follow in parentheses
after the Central stamp.  Product UI stays the viewer's timezone.  Wire
formats (JSON, logs, DB) stay UTC.
