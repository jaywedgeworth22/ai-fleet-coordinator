name: deploy-verify
description: Verify production after a merge or deploy — per-app health URLs, Coolify vs Vercel vs library-tag, backup continuity, and known failure classes. Use after merging to main, after a Coolify/Vercel deploy, when health looks stale, or when the owner asks if prod is up. Do not treat Coolify API status as truth.

# Deploy verification (MONET)

> **Shared `~/.claude/skills`.** Monet, Claude/Fable, and (when active) Renoir all load this directory.  Do not treat the word Monet in examples as proof of your seat.  Pin `AGENT_SEAT` / `AGENT_TAG` from the logged-in account before Slack or `board --by`:
> - Monet → `MONET`, Notes `Monet`, `monet/`, `~/apps/<app>-monet`
> - Claude / Fable → `CLAUDE`, Notes `Claude`, `claude/`, `~/apps/<app>-claude`
> - Renoir → `RENOIR`, Notes `Renoir`, `renoir/`, `~/apps/<app>-renoir`
> Cursor, Grok, Grok Bot, Codex, AG, DeepSeek, Kimi, and Fx have their own skill dirs and must not take identity from here.


Read `/Users/jay/apps/COOLIFY.md` before poking the API.  Prefer **public health + `docker ps` on the box** over Coolify UI/API `status` (that field goes stale).

Operator host (live 2026-08-07+): Hetzner NBG1 **`<PROD_ORIGIN_IP>`** / `fleet-hetzner-nbg1`.  SSH `ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner root@<PROD_ORIGIN_IP>`.  Dashboard `https://host.jays.services`.

**Retired — do not use:** `<HETZNER_IP_RETIRED>`, `<ORACLE_IP_RETIRED>`, Oracle Tailscale `<TAILSCALE_IP_RETIRED>`, Coolify UUID `<OLD_ST_COOLIFY_APP_UUID>`, token name `COOLIFY_API_TOKEN` on the command line.

## Token split

| Key | Use |
|-----|-----|
| `COOLIFY_SERVER_STATS` | Read-only.  App server-stats panels.  Infisical metrics token. |
| `COOLIFY_AGENTS` | Full deploy/admin.  Agent ops only.  **Never** store this in Infisical as the app's `COOLIFY_API_TOKEN`. |

Load via env, not argv.  Names only from the handoff file: `grep -oE '^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*' ~/.secrets/global-api-keys`.  See `secret-handoff`.

If Infisical still has `COOLIFY_API_TOKEN` for metrics, it must equal `COOLIFY_SERVER_STATS`.

## Per-app how merge becomes prod

| App | Production | Mechanism | Health |
|-----|------------|-----------|--------|
| ST | https://socratictrade.com | Coolify auto-deploy on `main`.  UUID `<ST_COOLIFY_APP_UUID>` (confirm live).  Merge == live — do **not** also click Deploy. | `curl -fsS -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; fleet-coolify/1.0)' https://socratictrade.com/api/health` |
| CT | https://congress.trade | Coolify auto-deploy (`app/**` / `services/**`).  UUID `<CT_COOLIFY_APP_UUID>`.  Worker `ship.sh` / `deploy.yml` is leftover. | `curl -sA 'Mozilla/5.0' https://congress.trade/api/health` (bare curl historically 403) |
| UM | https://usage.jays.services | Coolify webhook.  UUID `<UM_COOLIFY_APP_UUID>`.  Render and the Oracle auto-deploy timer are retired. | `curl -fsS https://usage.jays.services/api/health` and `curl -fsS 'https://usage.jays.services/api/ready?strict=1'` |
| DealDex | https://dealdex.online | **Vercel** on merge.  Do not Coolify.  `dealdex.vercel.app` is a different Next.js site. | `curl -sI https://dealdex.online` |
| Personal-Site | https://jays.services | Vercel behind Cloudflare.  **GitHub merge does not auto-publish live.**  Do not create a second Vercel project. | `curl -sI https://jays.services` |
| CTS | published tag `vX.Y.Z` | Library.  Announce on Slack, then tag.  Consumers pin the tag. | n/a |
| AFL | GitHub Pages digest | `fleet-activity-site.yml`, not Coolify. | `https://jaywedgeworth22.github.io/ai-fleet-coordinator/` + `curl -s https://mac.jays.services/health` |

Prefer live `GET /api/v1/applications` (via a helper that reads the token itself, or Coolify MCP) over memorized UUIDs.

AGENT-SYNC's "sanctioned deploy path" table still names ST uuid `<OLD_ST_COOLIFY_APP_UUID>`, CT Worker `deploy.yml`, and UM Render — **stale**.  Prefer this table + `~/apps/COOLIFY.md` (top Hetzner section only; the Oracle body below the cut is historical).

Steady state: ST/CT/UM auto-deploy via Coolify webhook; DealDex via Vercel; AFL digest via Pages; CTS via tag.  Announce-then-deploy (~10 min, one deployer) only for a **manual** Coolify/API click.  Do not double-trigger: Coolify cancel is unreliable.

## 1. App health (always start here)

ST fields are nested under `.checks` (camelCase):

```bash
curl -fsS -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; fleet-coolify/1.0)' https://socratictrade.com/api/health \
  | jq '.ok, .checks.db, .checks.schedulerAgeSeconds'
```

Expect `ok: true`, `db` ok, scheduler age small if a scheduler exists.  Root may 307 to `/login`.

CT: send a browser User-Agent.  A workflow red X on health is often a **false** Cloudflare challenge, not a failed deploy.

## 2. Coolify API (optional, often 403)

`host.jays.services` has sat behind a Cloudflare allowlist.  A 403 from your laptop is **not** a production outage.

Do not interpolate the token into a command you will see.  Prefer Coolify MCP or a wrapper that reads `COOLIFY_AGENTS` itself.  Expect `status: "finished"` only as a hint — then confirm public health and:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner root@<PROD_ORIGIN_IP> 'docker ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.Status}}"'
```

**Zombie:** a deploy stuck `in_progress` blocks the queue (`concurrent_builds` serializes).  Post `#agent-sync` with the deployment id if you can see it from the box.

**Silent freeze (ST #2545 class):** webhook 200 + healthy `/api/health` on an **old** sha.  Standing watch: ST `.github/workflows/deploy-freshness.yml`.  Do not hand-trigger; inspect the queue.

## 3. Backups (ST/CT/UM SQLite)

Litestream (or the host `/usr/local/sbin/fleet-sqlite-backup.sh`) is the DB path.  Prefer `/api/health` storage fields over browsing R2.

ST:

```bash
curl -s https://socratictrade.com/api/health \
  | jq '.checks.storage | {litestreamAgeSeconds, litestreamStatus, litestreamState, litestreamDegradedReasons}'
```

`storageDegraded: true` or `stale`/`stopped` → escalate immediately on Slack + board.

Litestream 0.5.12 is the pin after 0.5.14 leaked TCP sockets (2026-07-10).  Do not "upgrade" it casually.

Host scripts (cron): `fleet-sqlite-backup.sh`, `fleet-health-verify.sh`, `fleet-backup-verify-weekly.sh`.  Hetzner server backups are the outer layer — not sufficient alone for trading DB RPO.

## 4. Box checks

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/hetzner root@<PROD_ORIGIN_IP>
df -h / | grep -E 'Use%|^/dev'
ps aux | grep -E 'nixpacks|coolify' | grep -v grep
```

Disk hygiene timer already prunes above high watermarks.  Sustained pressure or a stuck build is a wedged queue — Coolify container logs, not a second deploy click.

Do not revert raised `tcp_mem` sysctl just because a deploy succeeded.

## 5. After verify

Move the effort row to **Deployed** only when you say how you verified.  `closeout` skill.  Rollback: Coolify previous deployment / Vercel rollback — not Mac pm2, not `trading-publish.sh` (retired).
