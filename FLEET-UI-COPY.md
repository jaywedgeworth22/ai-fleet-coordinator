# Fleet UI copy conventions (owner, 2026-08-07)

Binding for **every app, every bot, every platform** the owner can see —
**Socratic.Trade**, **Congress.Trade**, **Usage Monitor**, **DealDex**,
**Personal-Site**, **Autorotate**, **ContactLogo**, **BotFleet**, and any
future product.  Web, iOS, Android, chat replies, Bot settings, routine
settings, marketing HTML, App Store fields.



## Theme default = light (owner ruling 2026-08-10 — ALL apps, ALL agents)

Owner: default UI theme is **light**. Agents keep inventing dark-first or
"system" defaults that land on dark because the Mac is dark — stop that.

- **Default for first visit / no stored preference:** always **light**.
- **Do not** boot into dark from `prefers-color-scheme` unless the user has
  explicitly chosen **System** (or Dark).
- Dark remains an **optional** user choice via Light | Dark | System (or
  equivalent) — never the product default.
- **Screenshots / ASC / marketing / design previews:** capture in **light**
  mode unless the owner explicitly asks for dark. Existing ASC packs that
  are already light do not need a redo for this rule alone.
- Applies to every fleet app (web + iOS + Android + BotFleet chrome).
- Do not "make it look cool" with dark chrome by default. Light is correct.

## Proper nouns

- **Congress** and **Congressional** always take a capital **C** (U.S. proper nouns) in product copy, App Store text, and UI.
- Brand: **Congress.Trade**. Display URLs may use `https://Congress.Trade` (hostnames are case-insensitive; DNS/cert still resolve).
- Brand: **DealDex**. Do not reintroduce retired product names in user-facing copy.
- Keep technical identifiers lowercase: `trade.congress.ios`, `congress.trade` event names, email local-parts as configured.
## Headings / titles / buttons (strengthened 2026-09-03)

Owner, in-conversation 2026-09-03, **ALL bots ALL platforms ALL apps**:

Use **Title Case** (capitalize main words) for buttons, headings, titles,
menu items, tab labels, section names, dialog titles, Bot settings,
routine settings, and any chrome a human clicks or that names a region.

- Examples: `Agent Controls`, `Run Once`, `Win Rate`, `Needs Attention`,
  `Pending Proposals`, `Review 2 Proposals`, `Current Policy`,
  `Connected Accounts`, `Delete Account`, `Price Alerts`, `Last Run`,
  `Backend Remains Authoritative`, `Portfolio Brief`, `User Info`,
  `How It Works`, `Import From This Phone`, `Try Another`,
  `Working Folder`, `Tasks & Routines`.

## Values / answers / body (right side of labeled rows, subtitles that are data)

Use **sentence case** for body prose.  Use **sentence case or lowercase**
when the string is not a full sentence — not Title Case:

- Examples: `not reported`, `ask-first`, `intraday`, `not scheduled`,
  `every 60 min`, `open holdings`, `none waiting`,
  `account return minus SPY…` (lowercase leading **a**).

## Special cases
- **Latency vs other providers (CT, 2026-08-16):** never print `+` or `−` on
  lead/lag.  Positive seconds means we published first.  Say **earlier**
  (green) or **later** (red), plus the magnitude (`13.0h earlier`,
  `5.7h later`).  Later is always red.  Earlier is always green.
- `vs SPY` — leave as-is (exception to value casing).
- `Use` buttons — short; leave as `Use`.
- Prefer **not** saying “Live” for account reality. All connected accounts are real money.
  Paper only: `Alpaca (paper)` with lowercase **p**. No “Live” dots/pills next to account rows.
- Market session banner (when shown): stream glyph + **`Market Closed`** / **`Market Open`**
  (not bare `Closed` alone if redundant with a Markets card).

## Times and dates (owner 2026-08-09, amended 2026-08-12, strengthened 2026-08-22)
- **Product UI renders in the VIEWER's device timezone** — iOS, browser, desktop.  A user in
  another zone reading their own trade times in Central would be the bug, not the fix.
- **Two deliberate exceptions, both about accounting honesty, not localization:**
  - Console surfaces that pin a **market-day boundary** stay `America/Chicago`
    (`app/console/lib/format.ts`), because they must agree with the day boundary the P&L
    accounting itself uses (`startOfDayInTimeZone`, `src/lib/db-execution.ts`).  A "today"
    that means a different day than the numbers under it is wrong.
  - **Market-session times** are the market's, not the viewer's: say `9:30 AM ET`, labeled.
- **Always label the zone** when a time could be read in more than one (`2:41 PM CT`,
  `9:30 AM ET`).  Relative times (`3m ago`) need no label.
- Owner-facing agent writing (chat, boards, rollouts, Slack, Notes, release notes) is
  **Central Time, labeled**.  Never UTC-only when telling the owner a time.  UTC may follow
  in parentheses after the Central stamp.  `00:00 UTC` is 7:00 PM CT the previous calendar
  day in CDT (6:00 PM CT in CST).  That is a coordination rule, not a UI one.  See
  `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § Timestamps: Central Time.

## Money
- Compact suffixes **lowercase**: `$99.8k`, `$1.2m`, `$3.4b`.
- Home / hero equity (and places with room): **full** currency `$99,812.34`, not compact.

## iOS navigation titles
Always `.navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)` (small, centered) on root tab screens —
**not** large left-aligned titles that collapse only after scroll.

## Congress.Trade — no asset-class dropdown (owner 2026-08-14)

Do **not** add an All Assets / Public Equities, Funds, & ETFs / Stocks and ETF
dropdown on web or iOS.  It is worthless, unused, and a waste of space.
Never reintroduce it.  The server `assetClass=` param may stay for API clients;
the public UI must not grow a control for it.

## Congress.Trade — store listing and corpus accuracy (owner 2026-08-14)

The product corpus is **House, Senate, and Executive Branch** (OGE 278-T), not
Congress alone.  App Store description, promotional text, keywords, review
notes, IAP review notes, OG/RSS, and in-app blurbs must say so.  Do not write
“Congressional trades” or “House and Senate” as if that were the whole feed
(fixed 2026-08-13 in-app; App Store listing caught 2026-08-14).

Premium trial copy must match the live App Store introductory offer:
**2 weeks** (`FREE_TRIAL` / `TWO_WEEKS` on `trade.congress.premium.monthly`
and `.annual`).  Never ship leftover “1-month” / “1 month” trial text.

## Ticker logos
Show company logos next to ticker symbols wherever symbols appear (positions, orders,
watchlist, fills, proposals, scan tables). Fall back to monogram; never leave a blank hole.
Same open icon source as ST: `ticker-logos` / app logo proxy.

## Nothing is truncated without recourse (owner ruling 2026-09-04 — ALL apps, ALL agents)

Owner, in-conversation 2026-09-04: "errors that are ever truncated or anything
truncated should be able to be seen in full on mouseover anywhere on any app in
my opinion."

Binding for every fleet app — web, iOS, desktop, console tables, log and diff
viewers, Bot settings, routine settings, toasts and banners.  This is a bug
class, not a style preference.

- **If the UI shortens it, the UI owes the full value.**  Any string the layout
  clips — a table cell, a card title, a company name, a filename, a URL, a
  rationale, a stack frame, a chat message — must expose its complete text on
  hover.  Native `title` is the baseline and is always acceptable; a real
  tooltip component is better where the app already has one (Socratic.Trade
  console: the `Tooltip` primitive in `app/console/ui/primitives.tsx` — prefer
  it there over a bare `title=`).
- **Errors are the strict case.**  Error text must never be truncated without
  recourse.  An error someone cannot finish reading is an error they cannot act
  on — no offending field, no request id, no symbol, nothing to paste to an
  agent.  If an error banner clips, the full message goes in the hover title,
  and if it is long enough to need scrolling, give it an expand and a copy
  affordance too.
- **Truncating in code is worse than truncating in CSS.**  `.slice(0, 60)`,
  `substring`, a hand-appended `…`, or a server that returns a pre-shortened
  string destroys the full value before it ever reaches the DOM — nothing
  downstream can surface it, and the hover has nothing left to show.  Prefer CSS
  truncation (`text-overflow: ellipsis`, `line-clamp`) with the whole value
  still in the element or its `title`, and let the browser do the clipping.
  When a payload genuinely must be capped for size or cost, cap it at the edge
  and say so (`… 12 more lines`), never silently.
- **Hover is the floor, not the ceiling.**  Hover does not exist on touch and
  does not fire on keyboard focus, so a hover-only `title` leaves phone and
  screen-reader users with the clipped string and no way out.  The same full
  value must also be reachable by tap and by focus — an accessible
  tooltip/popover, a tap-to-expand, or an inline `Show More`.  Fleet precedent:
  board `404f7cc4` (Congress.Trade, hover-only titles on mobile cards) and the
  Socratic.Trade console pass that replaced bare `title=` with the accessible
  `Tooltip` primitive.
- **Never put a secret in a hover title.**  No API key, token, password, session
  cookie, signed URL, or `Authorization` value goes into a `title`, a tooltip,
  or an expanded error.  Titles get copied, screenshotted, pasted into Slack,
  and read aloud by screen readers.  Redact and keep the shape (`sk-…4f2a`), or
  surface a request id the owner can hand to an agent instead.

**Agent failure mode:** shipping a clipped error toast, a `line-clamp-2`
rationale, or a `.slice(0, 40)` label with no way to read the rest.  Fix on
sight.

## What is NOT in scope
- Code identifiers, API enums, log lines, internal “live stream” engineering labels
  (SSE, live snapshot) unless user-facing product chrome.

## Two spaces between sentences (owner rule 2026-08-08, strengthened 2026-08-10, 2026-08-14, and 2026-09-03 — ALL agents, ALL contexts)

Owner: **two spaces between sentences everywhere, including App Store
submission fields.**  Not optional.  Not “web only.”  Not “UI only.”
**Every single agent, every app, every surface, forever.**

**Strengthened again 2026-08-19 (owner, in-conversation):** "For any and all paragraphs in
any context, always use 2 spaces to separate a period from the beginning of a new sentence."
This closes the last loophole -- the rule is NOT limited to product/user-facing copy.  It
covers every paragraph an agent writes anywhere: **chat replies to the owner**, PR titles and
bodies, commit messages, Slack posts to #agent-sync, Apple Notes, effort-board rows, rollout
notes, review reports and design docs.  If it is prose, it gets two spaces.  (Single space
remains correct after a non-terminal abbreviation -- "e.g.", "v1.2.3".  In HTML preserve the
gap with NBSP+space or SENTENCE_GAP, since raw double spaces collapse.  In Markdown, note that
two spaces at the END of a line is a hard line break -- a different thing; this rule is about
the gap BETWEEN sentences.)

**HOW to emit it so it's actually visible (verified 2026-08-19, Socratic.Trade
PR #2893):** intent is not enough, the gap has to survive the renderer.  In a
**chat reply** (Claude Code terminal/desktop transcript, any agent chat UI), type
the literal HTML entity text `&nbsp;` right after the period, then a normal space
— `Sentence one.&nbsp; Sentence two.` — the markdown renderer expands the entity
into a visibly wider gap.  Tested and confirmed NOT to work in chat: two literal
spaces (collapsed by GitHub-flavored markdown); a raw U+00A0 character typed
directly (normalized away in the transcript view even though copy-paste out of it
can look right).  In a **file** (read as source, never through that renderer),
literal two ASCII spaces stays correct — do not switch file content to NBSP or
`&nbsp;`.  **Exception: Apple Notes `--html` and any other HTML a renderer
will show.**  Notes.app is an HTML renderer, so write
`Sentence one.&nbsp; Sentence two.`  Two ASCII spaces in a `<p>` collapse.

**Rendering trap -- SOLVED 2026-08-19, owner-verified.  How to actually emit the gap:**

- **Agent chat replies** (Claude Code terminal / desktop transcript): use the HTML entity
  `&nbsp;` immediately after the period, then a normal space --
  `Sentence one.&nbsp; Sentence two.`  The markdown renderer expands the entity, so the double
  gap is VISIBLE to the owner.
- **Files** -- repo markdown/text, commit messages, PR titles and bodies, Slack posts,
  effort-board rows, code comments: two LITERAL spaces.  These are read as source; an
  entity would appear as literal text.
- **HTML/JSX that a renderer will show** (Apple Notes `--html`, in-app HTML/JSX):
  `Sentence one.&nbsp; Sentence two.`  Notes.app is an HTML renderer — two ASCII
  spaces in a `<p>` collapse to one.  The notes helper converts leftover ASCII
  doubles after `.`/`!`/`?` into `&nbsp; `.  (Note: native SwiftUI `Text` does not
  decode HTML entities; use two literal spaces or Unicode `\u{00A0}` in Swift strings).

**What does NOT work, all tested in front of the owner:** two literal spaces in chat (GFM
collapses the run when rendering); a raw U+00A0 character in chat (normalized away in the view,
even though copy-paste showed two spaces -- do not be fooled by copy-paste); app settings (none
exist -- `outputStyle` changes tone only, `--output-format` is headless `claude -p` only,
`axScreenReader` only drops borders); patching the client (the CLI is a ~277MB compiled Mach-O
binary, the desktop app is a signed native bundle -- patching breaks code signing and is wiped by
auto-update; do not attempt).

**Process lesson that cost four rounds of owner correction:** when an instruction appears not to
take effect, diagnose the RENDERING/transport layer between you and the reader -- and ask what
they actually see on screen -- before restating a promise to comply.  Repeating "fixed" on output
the reader cannot see reads as ignoring them.

**Strengthened 2026-09-03 (owner, in-conversation, ALL bots ALL platforms ALL apps):**
the six characters `&nbsp;` must **never appear on screen** in cloud text, bot
answers, messages, ContactLogo.com, Bot settings, routine settings, or any
other owner-visible surface.  The gap still has to be two visible spaces.
If a renderer collapses ASCII doubles, the **backend** inserts a real U+00A0
(or equivalent) before the pixels.  BotFleet desktop `ChatMarkdown` already
maps the entity to U+00A0 for bot bubbles.  JSX/settings/iOS/marketing HTML
must not leak the entity as text — use `\u00A0` in JS strings, Unicode NBSP
in Swift, or a shared `SENTENCE_GAP` helper.  Agents writing into BotFleet /
OpenMausBot chat emit two ASCII spaces and let the renderer expand them.

Caught live 2026-08-14: Congress.Trade App Store **review notes** still said
“1-month free trial” with single spaces after periods, while the description
already said 2 weeks.  Agents had treated review notes as exempt.  They are
not.

**Where it applies (non-exhaustive — if a human reads it, use two spaces):**
- In-app UI strings (web, PWA, iOS native, widgets)
- **App Store Connect — all of it:** description, promotional text, What’s New,
  **App Review notes**, **subscription / IAP review notes**, subscription
  localization descriptions, support/marketing blurbs
- Push / email / Slack-to-owner product copy / help / privacy / terms prose
- Apple Notes completion notes, rollouts meant for the owner, README user prose
- Marketing, screenshot captions, TestFlight “What to Test”

**How:**
- Between sentences in a paragraph: `end.  Start` (two ASCII spaces after `.` `!` `?`)
- HTML/JSX/SwiftUI that collapses spaces: use NBSP+space
  (`&nbsp; ` / `{"\u00A0 "}` / `\u00A0 `) or a shared helper (ST: `SENTENCE_GAP`)
- Prefer ONE paragraph for short related sentences over stacked one-liners when
  the owner asked for density (see Socratic proposals empty-state, 2026-08-08)
- Do not insert spaces after brand periods (`Congress.Trade`), URLs, emails, or `U.S.`

**Does NOT apply:** code identifiers, commit messages (normal spacing is fine
for git), log lines, API enums, pure bullet lists of fragments with no
sentence terminator.

**Agent failure mode:** shipping App Store description, review notes, or UI
paragraphs with single spaces after periods, or stale trial/corpus copy.
Fix on sight.  Protocol: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § Two spaces.

## Run-once glyph = emoji bolt (owner preference 2026-08-08, Socratic.Trade)
The Run-once affordance uses the colored emoji ⚡ (U+26A1), not a line-icon Zap —
owner: the emoji "reads better than the one on the site." Keep Start/Resume on the
Play glyph (two "go" line-icons side-by-side read as competing primaries). When copy
references the control inline, use the ⚡ emoji there too.
